       "'Sustainable Development Report 2015\\n\\nTogether for Tomorrow\\n\\nMessage from the Chief Executive\\n2015 was a good year for Cathay Pacific. We recorded our best financial performance  \\nin the last five years, which was a tremendous achievement by the team especially  \\nunder challenging circumstances. This year we made great strides revamping our  \\nbrand philosophy, introduced new products and services, and advancing technological \\ninnovation. I believe these efforts will really help lay a strong foundation to better position \\nourselves for many years to come.\\nThe industry in which we are operating remains challenging as a result of economic \\noutlook, volatility in fuel prices and increasing regulation. I see sustainability as a key \\nstrategic value to help mitigate some of these risks, place us in a competitive position, \\nand providing us with the licence to grow in the future.\\n\\n“We want our business to be successful  \\nand we got to make it sustainable. I ask \\neveryone to be innovative and to contribute \\nto the environment and the future.”\\nIvan Chu\\nChief Executive\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\x0cMessage from the Chief Executive\\n\\n2015 was a landmark year, with the Climate Change Paris Agreement making a significant \\nstatement and progress towards a solution to global climate change. We welcome the \\ncall on governments and businesses to act on our collective responsibility. To that end, \\nwe continued to invest in new fleet to make our airline as efficient as possible, which  \\nalso helps minimise our carbon footprint. We also actively explore other avenues in \\nsustainable alternative fuel in order to reduce our reliance on the use of fossil-based fuel.\\nLast year, we retired less fuel efficient aircraft and worked closely with the manufacturer \\nand a supplier to embark on an innovative solution to recycle our A340s, where 90% of \\nthe aircraft by weight could be recovered. We also introduced different ways to engage \\nour staff using internal social media platforms like Yammer to better facilitate dialogues \\nbetween staff, as well as a crowdsourcing platform that made it easier for staff to \\ncontribute ideas on sustainability.\\nLooking ahead, 2016 promises to be an eventful year for us and the aviation industry.\\nWe are very excited to be receiving the first batch of our new A350s. Not only do these \\naircraft offer the latest advances in technology, operations, passenger comfort and \\nnavigation, they will deliver a step change in efficiency and other environmental benefits. \\nThis will really help us meet our carbon reduction objectives.\\nAnother big occasion will be the ICAO’s 39th Assembly in autumn of 2016. All eyes will be \\non ICAO to reach an agreement on the key construct of the Market-Based Measures to \\ncap aviation emissions at 2020 levels. International effort to agree and design the scheme \\ntogether has not been an easy process. I cannot stress enough the importance for  \\nall parties involved to work together to reach an agreement. If we fail, the uncertainty  \\nof a ‘patchwork’ of regulations globally will certainly make our industry less efficient  \\nand competitive.\\nTogether, we have developed a strong capability in sustainability over the years and  \\nI look forward to the team continuing to make efforts against our strategy and carrying \\non innovating and making our airline as sustainable as possible for tomorrow.\\n\\nIvan Chu\\nChief Executive\\n\\nWant to find out \\nmore? Go to our \\nvideo on the right.\\n\\nIvan Chu, Chief Executive, \\ntalks about the latest Sustainable Development Report in this video. \\n\\nOur video, Working Towards a Sustainable Future, highlights what Cathay Pacific \\nis doing to make aviation more sustainable.\\n\\n2\\n\\nTogether for TomorrowCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cTogether for Tomorrow\\n\\nTogether for Tomorrow\\nAn Introduction to the Cathay Pacific  \\nSustainable Development Report 2015\\nSustainability has been a constant pursuit over the years at Cathay Pacific. We believe \\nsustainability is most successful when teams work together to achieve our common \\nlong-term goals. Issues such as fuel efficiency can only really be tackled cross \\ndepartments with operations, engineering, product and services teams working on \\nrelated solutions. Our focus on staff engagement this year through IT platforms reflects \\nthis ambition. Applications like Yammer and crowd sourcing tools allow us to break down \\nsilos and enable us to work together more effectively.\\nWorking together also extends to our partnerships and stakeholders outside of our \\nairline. This is why we continue to participate and stay in touch with industry associations, \\ngovernments, NGOs and the global community to address and solve problems our \\nindustry faces\\nThis year has seen a continuation in our sustainability efforts as we continue to make \\nsteady steps to improve our efficiencies and reduce our impacts as well as making \\ninroads into better integrating and communicating our efforts.\\nThroughout this report you will find details of new initiatives that we have been pursing \\nover this past year together with new videos to tell our stories.\\n2016 will mark a historic moment in aviation and environment with the ICAO Market-Based \\nMeasures expected to be agreed, which will really be game changing in how we deal with \\ncarbon emissions as an industry and as a company. As we continue to progress on our \\ncommitments we are already laying the foundations for tomorrow’s challenges.\\n\\n“Sustainability is most successful when \\nteams work together to achieve our  \\ncommon long-term goals.”\\nJohn Slosar\\nChairman\\n\\n3\\n\\nTogether for TomorrowCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cApproach to Sustainable Development\\n\\nApproach to Sustainable Development\\nOur Journey to Sustainable Development\\nCathay Pacific has been enabling our customers to travel well for almost seven decades. \\nWe want to be able to sustain our ability to provide such premium services for years  \\nto come. This means, amongst other things, using resources responsibly, being \\npurposeful in reducing the waste we produce, to foster meaningful collaborations,  \\nand be single-minded in fulfilling our commitments.\\nIn 1980, Cathay Pacific became one of the first airlines in the world to implement fuel \\nefficiency measures – enabling us to undertake the first nonstop flight from Hong Kong \\nto London. We then implemented these on our long-haul routes beginning with our \\nnonstop flight from Hong Kong to Vancouver in 1982, and subsequently applied this \\napproach throughout our fleet and worldwide routes.\\nAs part of the Swire Group, a statement in 1989 by our honorary life president and former \\nChairman, Sir Adrian Swire, continues to inspire positive purpose in the company:\\n\\n“As a Group we should always seek to be \\nahead of legislation rather than reacting to it: \\nthat even if the environmentally “clean” way of \\ndoing something is more expensive and \\ntherefore on the face of it uneconomic, we \\nshould always, regardless of mandatory \\nlegislation, have a close look at the overall \\nfeasibility of adopting such a practice, both \\nfrom the point of view of general public good \\nand enlightened self-interest.”\\nSir Adrian Swire\\nHonorary life president and former Chairman\\n\\nThis approach defines what sustainable development means to us – it is about applying \\nlong term thinking in the business, doing the right thing by the environment and our \\nstakeholders, which results in long term success and a sustained existence.\\nCathay Pacific’s current programme of CSR activities began back in 1991 with the launch \\nof Change for Good, although we already had community activities since the 1970’s, with \\nthe purpose of giving back to Hong Kong and to the communities in which we operate.\\n\\n4\\n\\nTogether for TomorrowCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cApproach to Sustainable Development\\n\\nOn employee remuneration, we became one of the first companies in Hong Kong to \\nprovide flexible benefit schemes to our employees and formal management training \\nprogrammes for pilots, engineers and general managers.\\nIn 1996, we became one of the first Hong Kong companies to publish a voluntary publicly \\navailable Environmental Report for our stakeholders, which eventually evolved into our \\nfirst Sustainable Development Report in 2009.\\nIn 2012, with the support of various departments, we launched our Sustainable \\nDevelopment Strategy 20/20 commitments.\\nThanks to the concerted effort of our colleagues, we were one of the few airlines and \\nHong Kong companies to be listed simultaneously in the FTSE4Good, Dow Jones \\nSustainability Index Asia-Pacific, and the Hang Seng Sustainability Index in 2013.  \\nWe were also listed as a constituent of the Climate Disclosure Leadership Index Asia \\nex-Japan category under the Carbon Disclosure Project.\\nOur journey has been full of challenges. Since 1980, we have experienced our record-\\nbreaking profit years and our first profit loss; we have gone through Severe Acute \\nRespiratory Syndrome (SARS); a number of economic downturns; to record highs in Hong \\nKong’s economy. Throughout this time, our sustainability commitments matured – from \\nfocussing on environmental issues, to beginning to address social issues, to integrating \\nenvironmental, social and economic issues into our strategy.\\nThis year’s report is testament to our continued efforts in ensuring Cathay Pacific stays \\non the path to fully embedding the value and practice of sustainability into how we \\nconduct day-to-day business. We have made significant progress, but sustainability \\nissues have become far more complex, the solutions need to be more innovative, and  \\nthe actions need to be taken more urgently.\\n\\n5\\n\\nTogether for TomorrowCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cApproach to Sustainable Development\\n\\nSustainable Development Strategy\\nCathay Pacific remains committed to maintaining a high standard of corporate governance \\nand devotes considerable effort to putting in place best practices in accordance with  \\nour Code of Conduct on Corporate Governance\\u2009\\nsustainable development within the Cathay Pacific Group is shown in this diagram:\\n\\n. The structure for governing \\n\\nThe functions of these committees and working groups, as well as how we manage  \\nrisks and ensure corporate compliance, are described in the Sustainability Governance \\n of this report and the Corporate Governance Report in the Cathay Pacific \\nfactsheet\\u2009\\nAirways Annual Report 2015 p.37-48.\\n\\n6\\n\\nTogether for TomorrowCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cApproach to Sustainable Development\\n\\nThe Cathay Pacific Sustainable Development Strategy is designed to embed sustainability \\ninto mainstream thinking of the company and hence in everything we do.\\nThe development of the Strategy in 2009 resulted in five “priority areas” against which \\ndifferent departments, business units and subsidiaries of Cathay Pacific have been \\nimplementing sustainable development initiatives. These five priority areas enable us to \\nset specific targets and move purposefully toward our goal. They also encompass the \\nkey components of who we are and how we work. In 2012, we launched our 20/20 SD \\ncommitments, and each commitment is highlighted under each of the five priority areas.\\n\\n7\\n\\nTogether for TomorrowCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cApproach to Sustainable Development\\n\\nOur Sustainable Development Targets\\nAlthough the 20 commitments are being implemented by different business functions, \\nand, in turn, address different stakeholder priorities, they all promote Cathay Pacific’s \\nsustainable development targets which cut across the group’s activities and aim to:\\na)  Reduce our overall emissions;\\nb)  Offer sustainably sourced products and services to our customers; and\\nc)  Ensure our community programmes are relevant and effective to the beneficiaries.\\nThis is what the above three targets mean to us:\\na)  Reducing Emissions\\n  According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the \\nInternational Energy Agency (IEA), aviation currently accounts for 2% of global \\ngreenhouse gas emissions from human activity. As aviation grows to meet increasing \\ndemand, the IPCC has forecasted that, by 2050, the industry’s greenhouse gas \\nemissions could rise to 3%. While forecasts for 2050 can vary significantly, they \\nhighlight a challenge that the aviation industry will face over the next 40 years.\\nProjected increases in our emissions cannot be left unchecked, and that is why we \\nare firmly committed to reducing our impacts. The industry has directed significant \\ninvestment towards addressing the challenge, introducing new technology, better \\noperating procedures and sustainable biofuels.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Within Cathay Pacific, aircraft emissions constitute 99% of our overall CO2 emissions. \\n\\nTherefore we have committed to manage our carbon emissions and contribute to \\nglobal efforts to reduce aviation’s impact on the environment and climate change.  \\nIn fact, we commit to improving our fuel efficiency by 2% year on year to 2020,  \\nwhich is in line with ICAO’s target for the industry. At the same time, we are actively \\nmanaging the energy and water impacts of our facilities, vehicle fleet and the \\nequipment we use across our subsidiaries.\\nTo learn more about our performance on this target, go to our Climate Change  \\nfactsheet\\u2009\\n\\n.\\n\\n \\n\\n8\\n\\nTogether for TomorrowCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cApproach to Sustainable Development\\n\\nb)  Offering Sustainably Sourced Products and Minimising Resource Use\\n  We continually examine options to reduce resource use throughout our supply chain \\nand to use materials from sustainable sources (such as Forestry Stewardship Council \\nand Marine Stewardship Council-certified products, or recycled materials). We ensure \\nour procurement team understand the requirements of our Supply Chain Sustainability \\nCode of Conduct, so they can, in turn, ensure our suppliers comply with our standards. \\nWe also look for opportunities to improve recycling and waste management across  \\nall facets of our operations. These include products and services provided inflight and \\nat airport lounges, back office operations and the maintenance, repair and overhaul \\n(MRO) process of our aircraft.\\nTo learn more about our performance on this target, go to our Waste Management \\nfactsheet\\u2009\\n\\n, Sustainable Sourcing factsheet\\u2009\\n\\n and Biodiversity factsheet\\u2009\\n\\n.\\n\\n \\n\\nc)  Ensuring the Effectiveness of Community Programmes\\n  We support and invest in the Hong Kong community, of which we have been a part for \\nmore than six decades. Local staff members are also active in community initiatives in \\nthe outport countries where we have a presence.\\n\\n  Since 2011, we began making reference to the internationally-recognised London \\nBenchmarking Group (LBG) methodology in evaluating one of our flagship projects, \\nEnglish On Air. English On Air provides English-speaking opportunities for young \\nHong Kong residents. The LBG methodology involves assessing how our goals align \\nwith beneficiaries’ needs and expectations. We aim to ensure that our community \\nprogrammes truly respond to their needs and play to our strengths.\\n\\n  Our global community investment strategy is to leverage the resources of our \\ncompany and to motivate our staff and passengers to address the needs of the \\ncommunities we serve, focusing mainly on three areas: youth and education, medical \\ncare and environmental conservation.\\n\\n  Apart from our work in Hong Kong, we strongly encourage our outport staff to get \\n\\ninvolved in their local communities and to proactively identify appropriate NGO \\npartners with a view to exploring cooperation opportunities that will benefit the  \\nlocal community.\\nTo learn more about our performance on this target, go to our Community Investment \\nfactsheet\\u2009\\n\\n and Our People factsheet\\u2009\\n\\n.\\n\\n \\n\\n9\\n\\nTogether for TomorrowCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cApproach to Sustainable Development\\n\\nOur 20/20 Sustainability Commitments\\nIn 2010, we developed our Sustainable Development Strategy. In 2012, we launched our \\nvision for how this Strategy will be realised through 20 commitments, to help us define \\nwhat we intend to do and achieve by 2020. These commitments encompassed the key \\noperational areas of our business, right across our flights, catering services, ground fleet, \\noffices, suppliers and the communities we fly to. This is the result of years of engagement \\nwith our key stakeholders: our employees, passengers, investors, company management, \\ncommunity neighbours, subject experts and academics. \\n\\nCX Commitments\\u2002\\nCommitments by 2020\\n2% year-on-year improvement in fuel efficiency\\nDevelop a cost-effective strategy to incorporate sustainable aviation fuel \\ninto our operations\\nEmbed climate change adaptation into overall risk management\\nReduce electricity use by 25%\\nGround vehicles to use alternative fuels/power source\\nAll Cathay Pacific Group-owned buildings, offices and lounges will consider \\ngreen building standards or principles\\nOffer carbon offsetting as part of all ticket-related marketing and \\npromotional activities\\nDevelop and implement a sustainable cargo policy \\nAll meals served inflight and on the ground will meet sustainability criteria\\nReduce the environmental impact of maintenance, repair and overhauls \\n(MRO) carried out in Hong Kong by 50% \\nReduce material usage and waste by 25%\\nIncrease recycling by 25%\\nAll Cathay Pacific Group-branded materials will be produced using \\nsustainable materials\\nAll paper, paper products and textiles offered to customers or as part of the \\nservice offering will be made of sustainable materials\\nEngage with suppliers of inflight sales products on sustainability principles\\nAll suppliers will comply with our Supply Chain Code of Conduct\\nAll meals served inflight and on the ground will meet sustainability criteria\\nCX Holidays to offer at least five more ecotourism packages by 2015\\nAll holiday packages offered by CX Holidays will be verified for their \\nsustainability impacts\\nImplement London Benchmarking Group (LBG) methodology to evaluate \\nmajor company community projects\\nImplement CX community investment guidelines by 2015\\n\\n* Baseline is 2009 unless otherwise indicated.\\n\\nSection of the Report to  \\nwhich this issue relates to\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nBiodiversity\\n\\nWaste Management\\n\\nSustainable Sourcing\\n\\nSustainable Sourcing\\nBiodiversity\\n\\nSustainable Sourcing\\n\\nSustaining a Life Well \\nTravelled/Sustainable \\nDevelopment Strategy\\n\\n10\\n\\nTogether for TomorrowCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cApproach to Sustainable Development\\n\\nEvolution of Our Approach to Reporting\\nSince 2012, our SD report has been structured according material issues in response  \\nto stakeholder needs.

We then draw on our regular stakeholder engagement exercises to monitor \\ncurrent priorities and emerging issues. Although the importance of certain issues, such \\nas waste management, sustainable sourcing and biodiversity, has increased over the \\nyears, some of the topics such as climate change have remained high as stakeholders’ \\npriorities over the years.

However strong competition, a significant reduction in  \\nfuel surcharges, unfavourable foreign currency movements and a higher proportion  \\nof passengers were connecting through Hong Kong put downward pressure on yield. \\nCongestion at Hong Kong International Airport and air traffic control constraints in the \\nGreater China region also weighed down on our operating expenses.\\nThroughout the year, Economy class demand was strong. Premium class demand \\nimproved on regional routes but was not as strong as expected on some long-haul routes. \\nAir cargo demand weakened from the second quarter and remained lacklustre for the \\nrest of the year.\\nWe continued to invest heavily in our products and brands and in the development of  \\nour network. New or refurbished lounges were opened in Hong Kong, Manila, Bangkok, \\nSan Francisco and Taipei.

These commitments encompassed the key \\noperational areas of our business, right across our flights, catering services, ground fleet, \\noffices, suppliers and the communities we fly to. This is the result of years of \\nengagement with our key stakeholders: our employees, passengers, investors, company \\nmanagement, community neighbours, subject experts and academics.\\n\\nCX Commitments\\u2002\\nCommitments by 2020\\n\\n2% year on year fuel efficiency\\nDevelop a cost-effective strategy to incorporate sustainable aviation \\nfuel into our operations\\nEmbed climate change adaptation into overall risk management\\nReduce electricity use by 25%\\nGround vehicles to use alternative fuels/power source\\nAll Cathay Pacific Group-owned buildings, offices and lounges will \\nconsider green building standards or principles\\nOffer carbon offsetting as part of all ticket-related marketing and \\npromotional activities\\nDevelop and implement a sustainable cargo policy\\nAll meals served inflight and on the ground will meet  \\nsustainability criteria\\nReduce the environmental impact of maintenance, repair and  \\noverhauls carried out in Hong Kong by 50%\\nReduce material usage and waste by 25%\\nIncrease recycling by 25%\\nAll Cathay Pacific Group-branded materials will be produced using  \\nsustainable materials\\nAll paper, paper products and textiles offered to customers or  \\nas part of the service offering will be made of sustainable materials\\nEngage with suppliers of inflight sales products on sustainability \\nprinciples\\nAll suppliers will comply with our Supply Chain Code of Conduct\\nAll meals served inflight and on the ground will meet sustainability \\ncriteria\\nCX Holidays to offer at least five more ecotourism packages by 2015\\nAll holiday packages offered by CX Holidays will be verified for their \\nsustainability impacts\\nImplement London Benchmarking Group (LBG) methodology to \\nevaluate major company community projects\\nImplement CX community investment guidelines by 2015\\n\\nSection of the Report to  \\nwhich this issue relates to\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nBiodiversity\\n\\nWaste Management\\n\\nSustainable Sourcing\\n\\nSustainable Sourcing\\nBiodiversity\\n\\nSustainable Sourcing\\n\\nSustaining a Life Well \\nTravelled/Sustainable \\nDevelopment Strategy\\n\\n\\u2002Achieved\\u2003\\u2003 \\u2002On Plan\\u2003\\u2003 \\u2002Off Plan\\n12\\n\\n2015 ProgressCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cOverview of 2015\\n\\nSelected Awards for Cathay Pacific and Dragonair 2015\\n\\n\\u2002CATHAY PACIFIC\\n\\nSkytrax World Airline Awards\\nBest Transpacific Airline\\n\\nBusiness Traveller Asia-Pacific Awards 2015\\n•  Best Frequent Flyer Programme\\n•  Best Airline Lounge in Asia-Pacific\\n\\n26th Annual TTG Travel Awards\\nBest North Asian Airline\\n\\n2015 Randstad Award\\nMost Attractive Employer Award\\n\\n\\u2002DRAGONAIR\\n\\nSkytrax World Airline Awards 2015\\n•  World’s Best Regional Airline\\n•  Best Regional Airline in Asia\\n\\n26th Annual TTG Travel Awards\\nBest Regional Airline\\n\\nAustralian Business Traveller Awards 2015\\n•  Best First Class Lounge (The Pier Hong Kong)\\n•  Best First Class Amenity Kit\\n\\nYahoo Emotive Brand Awards 2014-2015\\nAirline Category\\n\\nJACDEC Airline Safety Ranking 2015\\nThe world’s new leading airline in terms  \\nof its safety record\\n\\nCellars in the Sky 2014 by Business  \\nTraveller Magazine\\nBest Business Class Sparkling – Gold  \\n(Champagne Cuvee William Deutz 2000)\\n\\n2015 Business Traveller China Awards\\nBest Airline Economy Class\\n\\nYahoo Emotive Brand Awards 2014-2015\\nAirline Category\\n\\n13\\n\\n2015 ProgressCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cSustainable Development Report 2015\\n\\nSafety\\n\\nSafety Matters\\nAt Cathay Pacific we strive to maintain the highest levels of safety and always put \\nsafety first.\\nAt Cathay Pacific, we have a longstanding and clear focus on safety that is embedded in \\nthe organisation. Our goal is to manage the risks of the operation to As Low As Reasonably \\nPractical (ALARP) in order to allow the company to pursue and maintain its commercial \\nactivities in a sustainable way.\\nOur Safety Policy, signed by the Chief Executive, clearly articulates this commitment  \\nby stating that “safety is our number-one priority” and that we are “fully committed to \\nproviding a safe operational and working environment” for all our passengers and staff.  \\nIt goes on to state that “ultimate accountability rests with me as Chief Executive. However, \\nresponsibility for safety lies with each and every one of us in the airline”.\\nWe have well-developed and deeply-embedded proactive safety systems to ensure that \\nwe can deliver the results. Developments made in 2015 will ensure that we live up to these \\nexacting standards.\\n\\n“If we don’t know where the risks lie, we can’t \\nmitigate them effectively.”\\nRichard Howell\\nGeneral Manager Corporate Safety and Security\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\x0cUpdates for 2015\\n\\nUpdates for 2015\\nGroup Safety Integration\\nThe Corporate Safety departments of Cathay Pacific and Dragonair were merged in two \\nstages under one General Manager. The objective of this merger was to create a single \\nGroup Safety department, enabling the better sharing of resources and expertise across \\nboth operations. The integrated approach across both airlines ensures that functions  \\nare aligned to support a common purpose and outcomes, such as safety governance \\nstructures, training and communications, risk management processes and performance \\nmonitoring. The merger also introduces opportunities to become more efficient, \\nconsolidating and focusing resources on common safety issues and avoiding duplication \\nof effort in safety management. Furthermore, centralised administrative activities leave \\nmore time to focus on proactive safety interventions.\\nIATA Enhanced International Operational Safety Audit\\nFollowing Cathay Pacific’s completion of an IATA Enhanced International Operational \\nSafety Audit in 2014, Dragonair successfully completed its first Enhanced IOSA achieving \\nzero findings in December 2015. Cathay Pacific aims to renew its Enhanced IOSA \\naccreditation in June 2016.\\nAirbus A350 Entry into Service Preparation\\nAs the first airline to deploy its pilots to fly both the Airbus A330 and A350 from the  \\nstart of the A350 operation under a single licence, Cathay Pacific has been proactively \\nmanaging the risks associated with the entry into service of the A350 since 2014. A full \\nrisk assessment, approved by the Hong Kong CAD, was completed for this activity. Extra \\nmitigations that go beyond those recommended by Airbus have been implemented to \\nensure that the A350 joins the Cathay fleet in a carefully managed way.\\nMental Health of Flight Crew\\nFollowing the tragic loss of 150 people on Germanwings Flight 9525, our Corporate \\nMedical Department initiated a review of pilot hiring and medical screening practices,  \\nas well as reviewing work conducted at an international level. It was determined that  \\nthe airline’s current processes and mitigations for addressing mental health issues are \\nappropriate. Furthermore, we developed a random Alcohol and Drug testing programme \\nwhich will be implemented in November 2016 for roll out not just to pilots but to all \\nsafety-sensitive staff, including cabin crew and load controllers.\\n\\n2\\n\\nSafetyCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cUpdates for 2015\\n\\nBan on Hoverboards in Passenger Luggage and Carry on\\nFollowing reports from various sources, including one incident involving another airline  \\nof a hoverboard battery causing a fire during inspection, we conducted a thorough risk \\nassessment of this emerging hazard. Subsequently, a risk-based decision was made to \\nimplement a total ban on the carriage of these lithium battery powered hoverboards in \\npassenger cabin and check-in baggage for both Cathay Pacific and Dragonair.\\nCultivating a Strong Reporting Culture\\nIn order to facilitate a strong reporting culture, which is a sign of a healthy safety culture, \\nCathay Pacific and Dragonair staff are encouraged to report freely to the company. This \\nwould help facilitate safety actions for the benefit of learning and improving the overall \\nsafety of operations. A flow of safety reports generally demonstrates an excellent active \\nreporting culture.\\nDuring the past five years, the number of Ground Safety Reports received by the Group \\nSafety Department, for both Cathay Pacific and Dragonair operations, has increased due \\nto two main drivers:\\na)  a move from primarily paper-based reporting to electronic channels; and\\nb)  a substantial increase in the reporting of hazards and insignificant risk occurrences.\\nThe improved intelligence provided by the reports has become a key driver in the Cathay \\nPacific and Dragonair safety management system development.\\nCathay Pacific and Dragonair always target zero accidents. In 2015, with approximately \\n34 million passengers carried, there were no events classified as an accident. There were \\nno staff fatalities and zero serious work-related injuries in 2015. The total number of lost \\ntime injuries reduced by 25.5% year-on-year.\\n\\n3\\n\\nSafetyCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cUpdates for 2015\\n\\nTo manage and mitigate potential injures, a three year programme of proficiency based \\nmanual handling training with the renowned Pristine Condition, a specialist in OH&S from \\nthe UK, was commenced in 2015. This programme targets three staff groups, namely \\ncabin crew, Hong Kong International Airport terminal staff and Hong Kong Airport Services \\nstaff who handle bags, mail and cargo on a daily basis. In addition to the lifting injuries \\nseen in the airport terminal, the training also addresses slips and trips which are also \\nprevalent there. A wider slips and trips and manual handling awareness campaign ran \\nthroughout 2015 for all staff based in Hong Kong.\\nOther initiatives and training were conducted in various departments across the company. \\nAt Cathay City, our Hong Kong headquarters, our facilities management company carried \\nout a Fire, Health and Safety Audit along with routine air quality surveys.

In particular, staff are proud of the safety culture, and feel that the company \\nis able to communicate effectively on safety issues. Cathay Pacific is also one of the first \\nairlines to implement a Fatigue Risk Management System.

We recognise the impacts of using and disposing of these \\nmaterials, such as the shortage of landfill space in Hong Kong. Therefore we have \\nmedium to long-term programmes in place to minimise these impacts and be \\nresponsible stewards of these resources. While we were seen by our stakeholders as \\nhaving improved in this area, they expect to see continued action on this urgent issue.\\nIn particular, our staff are concerned about what they can do in the working environment, \\nfor example, flight and cabin crew wanted to see more being done to tackle inflight waste, \\nwhile our ground staff wanted to see us take more proactive steps in offices and airports. \\nThis is a positive sign, as we are seeing our staff more willing to be involved in reducing our \\nuse of resources and increasing recycling and re-using where we can. This is encouraging \\nas many of our resource and waste management initiatives can only be achieved with the \\nsupport of our staff, both inflight and on the ground.\\nIn recent years, we have received considerable attention on our use of plastics inflight –  \\nthis was consistent amongst our different stakeholders – from passengers, staff and \\n  \\nenvironmental organisations.

We envision a sustainable supply chain within the \\nCathay Pacific Group, and working with our suppliers is key to delivering products \\nand services to our customers sustainably.\\nWe work with our suppliers on a supply chain sustainability compliance process as part \\nof our risk management process. Many of our suppliers are companies that also report \\npublicly on their sustainability performance and hold similar values towards corporate \\nresponsibility as ourselves.\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\x0cSustainable Sourcing Matters\\n\\nIn order to deliver products and services that are sustainably sourced, we need to work \\nwith our suppliers. Developing a sustainable supply chain is a challenge due to the large \\namount of items we purchase, each with varying specifications. In some cases, we may \\nnot have leverage on all our suppliers and have limited influence on the sustainability \\nattributes of these materials. Moreover, our specifications need to meet very strict safety \\nstandards, particularly if we are taking these items onboard. We are determined to find \\nsolutions to these challenges:\\n•  We participate in best practice sharing sessions locally and internationally: Since \\n2007 Cathay Pacific has been a member of the Swire Sustainable Purchasing Working \\nGroup, which looks at synergies within the Swire Group in embedding sustainable \\npurchasing practices in the Swire Pacific companies. We were a founding member  \\nof the Hong Kong Green Purchasing Charter in 2008. In 2013, we were also one  \\nof the founding participants of the inaugural Sustainable Lifestyles Working Group \\nlaunched by non-profit sustainability organisation Business for Social Responsibility \\nand sustainability communications firm Futerra. In 2015, the oneworld Procurement \\nBest Practises Working Group – CSR was established to understand how each \\nmember airline currently manages sustainability risk in their supply chains and  \\nshare best practises.\\n\\n•  We trial and use alternative materials and implement these across the Cathay Pacific \\nGroup: We often assess the performance of alternative materials. Once it passes  \\nthe trial phase, we implement the material across the whole Group. For example, when \\nwe decided to switch all office paper to sustainably- sourced material, we assessed \\ndifferent options from recycled paper to paper made from FSC sources. Since our \\ninitial purchase of sustainable office paper in 2008, currently the majority of office \\npaper, marketing collaterals in Hong Kong, training materials, inflight magazines and \\nteam newsletters have switched to FSC or recycled paper.\\n\\n2\\n\\nSustainable SourcingCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cSustainable Sourcing Matters\\n\\nSustainable Purchasing\\nOur purchasing practices are of the highest professional and ethical standards. Most of \\nthe purchasing requirements for both Cathay Pacific and Dragonair are managed by the \\nProcurement & Aircraft Trading Department. We require the procurement of all goods  \\nto be undertaken with full compliance to the applicable laws, tax regime and regulations \\nthat govern the specific transaction with full cognisance taken of our Anti-Bribery, \\nAnti-Trust and Data Protection policies.\\nWe aim to encourage our suppliers to improve on their sustainability practices through \\ncapacity building and sharing knowledge on best practices as part of our approach  \\nto sustainable procurement. Our purchasing teams understand the need to consider \\nsustainable purchasing and responsible supply chain practices in buying decisions.  \\nWe require our suppliers to provide clear, accurate and appropriate reporting of their \\nprogress in achieving our Supply Chain Sustainability Code of Conduct objectives.\\nSupply Chain Sustainability Code of Conduct\\nSince the launch of our Supply Chain Sustainability Code of Conduct in 2007, suppliers \\nto Cathay Pacific must provide clear, accurate and appropriate reporting of their \\nprogress toward achieving our objectives contained in this Code. These include:\\n•  Legal and regulatory compliance\\n•  Environmental management\\n•  No use of forced and child labour\\n•  Appropriate compensation and working hours\\n•  Health and safety in the workplace\\n•  No discrimination against employees\\n•  Upholding human rights in the workplace\\n•  Having high ethical standards\\n•  Extending social responsibility to their subcontractors and service providers\\n•  Maintaining documentation and permitting our inspection\\nIn developing and revising the Code, we took account of the International Labour \\nOrganization’s core conventions and other applicable and recognised labour standards, \\nreferred and benchmarked against the United Nations Global Compact.\\n\\n3\\n\\nSustainable SourcingCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cSustainable Sourcing Matters\\n\\nRevised Code of Conduct to include ethics\\n\\nIdentified the need for a more coordinated approach to \\nsustainability in our supply chain\\n\\nDeveloped and launched our Code of Conduct\\nFirst questionnaires sent to Hong Kong-based suppliers\\n\\nLaunched online tool for suppliers to complete questionnaire \\nregarding their compliance with our Code.

For many years, we have \\nbeen sponsoring habitat-protection programmes within Asia, and working with NGOs from \\nacross the region. For instance, working with Friends of the Earth, we provided funding \\nthat resulted in the planting of 10,000 tree seedlings around Hong Kong. We also raised \\nnearly HK$8 million from passengers to support conservation initiatives in mainland China \\nthrough The Nature Conservancy. Partnering with the Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Gardens \\nin Hong Kong, we helped reintroduce 609 endangered pig-nosed turtles to Indonesia  \\nby donating cargo space and air tickets to the organisation. Since at least 2009, Cathay \\nPacific has been engaging with shark conservation specialists and organisations to \\nunderstand the issue and explore our role as a responsible business. We are one of the \\nfirst airlines in the world to raise the awareness of the unsustainability of the global shark \\ntrade. We will continue to direct investments in biodiversity conservation as a way to give \\nback to the community.\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\x0cBiodiversity Matters\\n\\nIt is important that our inflight meals are sustainably sourced as well. On average,  \\nCathay Pacific and Dragonair serve 110,155 inflight meals everyday to our passengers. \\nTherefore, by adhering to international sustainability standards, we can have a substantial \\npositive impact on the diversity of a wide variety of ecosystems. We have already \\nadopted a Sustainable Food Policy that does not allow the serving of a number of \\nunsustainably produced food items, including shark fin soup, both inflight and at \\ncompany-paid functions. Since 2011, we have been serving fish from sustainable \\nsources, such as those that are Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certified, in Economy \\nClass on all our flights departing from Europe. We follow a similar policy for fish served  \\nin Economy Class on flights from Australian and North American ports.\\nTo learn more about what the Cathay Pacific Group has been doing to support  \\nhabitat-protection programs and adopt a strategy that incorporates biodiversity \\nconsiderations into our daily operations, go to our Biodiversity factsheet\\u2009\\n\\n.\\n\\n2\\n\\nBiodiversityCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cUpdates for 2015\\n\\nStop Fish Bombing!

With fewer than 100 of these animals \\nremaining in the wild in the world, Harapan was transported back to the Sumatran Rhino \\nSanctuary for breeding and conservation purposes. Harapan was accompanied by a \\nveteran animal keeper during the 16,000-kilometre journey. In preparation, the 816-kilogram \\nrhino underwent medical checks and was trained to walk into and voluntarily remain in his \\ncrate. In addition, we assisted the Toronto Zoo by shipping boots and filtration equipment \\nto rhino conservation rangers in Indonesia free of charge.\\nIn addition to adhering to the Convention on International Trade and Endangered Species \\n(CITES) requirements on the transport of endangered animals and plants listed under \\nAppendices 1 and 2 of the Convention, we placed an embargo on the transportation of  \\na) hunting trophies; and b) racing greyhounds (exporting from Australia to any destination \\nand importing to Hong Kong from any place of origins).\\nIn early 2015, we started supporting the work of Stop Fish Bombing!, a non-profit \\norganisation based in Hong Kong that incorporates a Silicon Valley-based technology \\ncompany and a TV production company in Malaysia. Stop Fish Bombing! is working with \\ngovernments, local authorities, NGOs, and the private sector to develop underwater \\nbomb detection technology against fish bombing and raise public aware on this issue.\\nIn mid-2015, an acceptance procedure for shark and shark-related products was  \\nissued to all Cathay Pacific and Dragonair ports. Requests for the shipment of shark  \\nor shark products were required to be assessed by an external expert panel of two  \\nhighly respected international shark conservation agencies, in accordance with the \\nsustainability of the species, before they could be considered for carriage.\\n\\n3\\n\\nBiodiversityCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cWhat Our Stakeholders Think\\n\\nWhat Our Stakeholders Think\\nToday, companies are increasingly expected to understand their biodiversity impact  \\nand to determine ways to protect and enhance biodiversity as part of their business \\noperations.

Identified Sustainability Information  The Identified Sustainability Information for the year ended 31 December 2015 is summarised below:  1) Greenhouse Gases (“GHG”) emissions data  Aircraft operations \\uf0b7 Carbon Dioxide (CO2)  Unit of measure Tonnes Other operations \\uf0b7 CO2 emission from electricity \\uf0b7 CO2 emission from ground vehicles \\uf0b7 CO2 emission from town gas Unit of measure Tonnes Tonnes Tonnes  2) Selected quantitative data \\uf0b7 The mathematical accuracy of the grammes/ATK and grammes/RTK computation for 2015 (to be used by the Company to determine fuel efficiency).  \\uf0b7 Outcome of the Fly greener programme in 2015: (i)  the total number of offsets for staff travelling on business, and  (ii) the total number of offsets bought by passengers.  \\uf0b7 Weight  of recycled material from inbound Hong Kong Cathay Pacific flights:  - Aluminium cans (kg) - Plastic cups (kg) - Plastic bottles (kg) - Glass bottles (kg)  \\uf0b7 Amount of recycled material from Cathay Pacific City and Dragonair House:  - Paper and cardboard (kg) - Aluminium cans (kg) - Plastic (kg) - Printer cartridges (pieces) (Note: Cathay Pacific City and Dragonair House combined figure)  \\uf0b7 Data regarding the English on Air (“EOA”) programme during the 2014/2015 academic year: “A total of 168 students from five schools in Tung Chung participated in the English on Air programme during the 2014/2015 academic year.”  \\uf0b7 Data regarding the food donation programme during 2015: “60 welfare centres received 116,000 kg of food and beverages.”  Our assurance was with respect to the year ended 31 December 2015 information only and we have not performed any procedures with respect to earlier periods or any other elements included in the Sustainable Development Report 2015 and, therefore, do not express any conclusion thereon. Cathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cIndependent Assurance Statement\\n\\n3\\n\\nAbout this Report  2   Criteria  The criteria used by the Company to prepare the Identified Sustainability Information is set out under the heading “Reporting Methodology” in the section “About this Report” of the Sustainable Development Report 2015 at www.cathaypacific.com/sdreport (the “Criteria”).  The Company’s Responsibility for the Identified Sustainability Information  The Company is responsible for the preparation of the Identified Sustainability Information in accordance with the Criteria. This responsibility includes the design, implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation of Identified Sustainability Information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.  Inherent limitations  The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-financial information allows for different, but acceptable, measures and measurement techniques and can affect comparability between entities. In addition, GHG quantification is subject to inherent uncertainty because of incomplete scientific knowledge used to determine emissions factors and the values needed to combine emissions of different gases.  Our Independence and Quality Control  We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour.   Our firm applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.  Our Responsibility  Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the Identified Sustainability Information based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained. We conducted our limited assurance engagement in accordance with (i) International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised), Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, for selected quantitative data, and, (ii) International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3410, Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements, for GHG emissions data, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. These standards require that we plan and perform this engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the Identified Sustainability Information is free from material misstatement.  A limited assurance engagement involves assessing the suitability in the circumstances of the Company’s use of the Criteria as the basis for the preparation of the Identified Sustainability Information, assessing the risks of material misstatement of the Identified Sustainability Information whether due to fraud or error, responding to the assessed risks as necessary in the circumstances, and evaluating the overall presentation of the Identified Sustainability Information. A limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in relation to both the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal control, and the procedures performed in response to the assessed risks.  The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment and included inquiries, observation of processes performed, inspection of documents, analytical procedures, evaluating the Cathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cIndependent Assurance Statement\\n\\n4\\n\\nAbout this Report  3  appropriateness of quantification methods and reporting policies, and agreeing or reconciling with underlying records.  Given the circumstances of the engagement, in performing the procedures listed above we:  \\uf0b7 Made inquiries of relevant management of the Company; \\uf0b7 Understood the process for collecting and reporting the Identified Sustainability Information; \\uf0b7 Undertook analytical procedures over the Identified Sustainability Information; \\uf0b7 Performed limited substantive testing on a selective basis of the Identified Sustainability Information; and \\uf0b7 Considered the disclosure and presentation of the Identified Sustainability Information.  The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had we performed a reasonable assurance engagement. Accordingly, we do not express a reasonable assurance opinion about whether the Company’s Identified Sustainability Information has been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria.  Limited Assurance Conclusion  Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Company’s Identified Sustainability Information for the year ended December 31, 2015 is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria.  Our report has been prepared for and only for the board of directors of the Company and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility towards or accept liability to any other person for the content of this report.

The majority of data is \\ncollated via Swire’s new sustainability management system, Resource Advisor, a database \\nfor our operations in Hong Kong covering Cathay Pacific, Dragonair, 100% owned and 60% \\nowned Hong Kong-based subsidiaries. Cathay Holidays Limited and outports reported \\nseparately via questionnaires. The new system facilitates collecting, consolidating, \\nanalysing and reporting our environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance \\nacross the Group’s diverse businesses located in different jurisdictions.\\n\\n6\\n\\nAbout this Report Cathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cReporting Methodology\\n\\nGHG Emissions Accounting and Reporting Policies\\nThe inventory of our greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions is reported in accordance with \\nthe World Resources Institute and World Business Council on Sustainable Development’s \\nGreenhouse Gas Protocol (2004, Revised Editions).\\nOrganisational Boundaries\\nThe Cathay Pacific Group reported the greenhouse gas emissions of each of its \\nsubsidiaries below in proportion to their ownership percentage. The organisational \\nboundaries for the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions include Cathay Pacific \\nAirways and the following 100% and 60% owned Hong Kong-based companies  \\n(the “subsidiaries”):\\n•  Hong Kong Dragon Airlines Limited (KA)\\n•  Cathay Holidays Limited (CHL)\\n•  Cathay Pacific Catering Services (H.K.) Limited (CPCS)\\n•  Cathay Pacific Services Limited (CPSL)\\n•  Hong Kong Airport Services Limited (HAS)\\n•  Vogue Laundry Service Limited (VLS)\\n•  AHK Air Hong Kong Limited (AHK) (60% owned)\\nOther principal subsidiaries and associates, as outlined on pages 98 to 99 of the Cathay \\nPacific Group 2015 Annual Report that are not included within the scope of this report, \\nwill be considered for inclusion in the future.\\nOperational Boundaries\\nThe operational boundaries for the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions are as follows:\\n•  Scope 1 – Direct GHG emission, including global CO2 emissions from flights, ground \\n•  Scope 2 – Electricity and Towngas (production) indirect GHG emissions\\nThe reporting period of the GHG data is the twelve-month period of 1 January to  \\n31 December 2015. The year 2009 has been used as the base year for comparing the \\nemissions profile of our flights in line with our 20/20 commitments. However, we continue \\nto provide information from 1998 to ensure consistency with our previous reporting. \\nPlease note there have been changes in organisation and operational boundaries over \\nthe years which may impact comparability.\\n\\nvehicles and Towngas combustion\\n\\n7\\n\\nAbout this Report Cathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cReporting Methodology\\n\\nScope 1 Emissions\\nScope 1 emissions include fuel and Towngas usage from ground-based activities in \\nHong Kong covering Cathay Pacific and the subsidiaries. In Hong Kong, the CO2 emission \\nfactors used follow the guidelines published by the Environmental Protection Department \\n(EPD) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HK SAR) Government in February \\n20101. For CO2 emission factors for outport data, references have been made to the \\nInternational Energy Agency (2010)2.\\nIn respect of our GHG emissions from aircraft fuel consumption, our scope includes  \\nall flight activities, including testing, training flights, dry lease and wet lease. As fuel \\ndensity varies according to a number of factors, we use the Joint Inspection Group’s3 \\nrecommended specific gravity of 0.80 kg/L to calculate the weight of fuel. We use the \\nIPCC’s emission factor of 3.154 to determine CO2 emissions from the combustion of \\naircraft fuel.\\nScope 2 Emissions\\nOur scope includes electricity consumption and Towngas production for our operations \\nin Hong Kong covering Cathay Pacific and the subsidiaries. Emission factors used in our \\nscope follow the guidelines published by the EPD of the HK SAR Government in February \\n2010, the International Energy Agency (2010), and the relevant utilities.\\nFor GHGs, other than CO2, others including CH4, N2O, PFCs and SFs are either not \\napplicable or not material to the overall GHG reporting.\\nTowngas is also used in the Cathay Pacific canteen. As this is operated by a third party, \\nconsistent with the previous year, it is specifically excluded.\\nMethodologies Used to Calculate or Measure Emissions\\nRefer to Endnote References.\\n\\n8\\n\\nAbout this Report Cathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cReporting Methodology\\n\\nOther Indicators\\nEnvironmental Indicators\\nThe scope of this year’s reported resource usage includes operations in Hong Kong \\ncovering Cathay Pacific, the 100% and 60% owned subsidiaries, energy consumption \\nand greenhouse gas data from four outports (Auckland, Taipei, Manila and San Francisco) \\nand non-GHG data from five outports (Frankfurt, Paris, Karachi, Kuala Lumpur and Sydney) \\nwhich were able to provide auditable numbers. We will continue to work on increasing the \\nscope to cover all major outports in future reports.\\nSocial Indicators\\nOperations in Hong Kong covering Cathay Pacific and the 100% and 60% owned \\nsubsidiaries are included on the Social Indicators table.\\nGRI Content Index\\nThe GRI Content Index is prepared with reference to the GRI G4 Guidelines ‘in accordance \\noption’ Core. The GRI Content Index does not reflect actual implementation of Cathay \\nPacific’s sustainable development initiatives nor the value or quality of the report and  \\nits content.\\nOther Matters\\nFLY greener Offsets\\nFLY greener offsets are calculated as the tonnes of CO2 purchased by all passengers \\n(including staff), using either cash or Air Miles as a method of payment. One tonne  \\nof CO2 had a cash price of HK$25.51 in 2015. The average Air Miles price was 626  \\nAir Miles per tonne of CO2 during the year ended 31 December 2015. The total tonnage \\nwas computed based on the amount paid during the year. Cash received during the year \\nrelated to flights taken in 2015.\\nFuel Efficiency\\nFuel efficiency is calculated as fuel usage per available tonne kilometre (ATK). ATK is \\ndefined in the Cathay Pacific Airways Limited Annual Report 2015 as overall capacity, \\nmeasured in tonnes available for the carriage of passengers, excess baggage, cargo  \\nand mail on each sector multiplied by the sector distance.\\nRTK is defined as traffic volume, measured in load tonnes from the carriage of passengers, \\nexcess baggage, cargo and mail on each sector multiplied by the sector distance.\\nThe fuel consumption figure shown on the Environmental Indicators Table only includes \\nCathay Pacific and Dragonair for comparability with last year’s report.\\nATK of 30,048 million and RTK of 22,220 million used in this calculation are taken from \\nthe Cathay Pacific Airways Limited Annual Report 2015.\\n\\n9\\n\\nAbout this Report Cathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cReporting Methodology\\n\\nRecycled Materials\\nIn 2015, materials recycled from inbound flights to Hong Kong include plastic cups; \\nplastic bottles; aluminium cans; and glass bottles. Materials recycled by the Cathay \\nPacific Airways and 100% owned subsidiaries include paper and cardboard, plastics, \\naluminium cans, waste lubrication oil, glass bottles and printer cartridges from Cathay \\nPacific City; and paper and cardboard, aluminium cans, plastic and printer cartridges \\nfrom Dragonair House. The amount of recycled materials refers to those recorded in \\neither recycling vendor invoices or internal tracking records.\\nFood Donation\\nIn 2015, unconsumed food items such as unopened juices, cereals, and pre-packaged \\nfood from Cathay Pacific inbound flights to Hong Kong were collected for donation to  \\na local food bank. The amount of donated food and beverages refers to those in the \\ntracking records of the local food bank.\\nEnglish on Air\\nEnglish on Air is an educational programme which involves English-speaking Cathay \\nPacific staff volunteers from a wide variety of nationalities and backgrounds who \\nencourage local students to speak English. Participating students are invited to Cathay \\nPacific City to meet and chat with volunteers during English-speaking sessions.\\nLondon Benchmarking Group\\nThe London Benchmarking Group model is used by companies to assess and report on \\nthe value and achievements of their corporate community investment. It takes the form \\nof a matrix that helps to summarise, and quantify, the achievements of a community \\nactivity. It breaks down the elements of the activity, detailing the different inputs, then \\ngoing on to establish the outputs and, eventually, the impacts that these have achieved.\\nWe evaluated the effectiveness of our English on Air activities run during the academic \\nyear 2014/2015 with reference to the London Benchmarking Group model. We developed \\nquestionnaires covering the areas indicated below and conducted surveys with the \\nparticipating students and teachers in order to develop a scorecard of these areas.\\n•  Leverage company resources\\n•  English opportunities\\n• \\nIncrease confidence\\n•  School partnership\\n•  Awareness of aviation and Cathay Pacific Airways\\n\\n10\\n\\nAbout this Report Cathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cReporting Methodology\\n\\nMateriality Matrix\\nThe materiality matrix plots our corporate social responsibilities issues in two dimensions: \\nthe importance of the issue to our stakeholders and the impact of the issue to Cathay \\nPacific.  In order to develop this, we have been engaging with a third party consultant \\nsince 2006 to perform focus groups and interviews with selected groups of stakeholders, \\nchosen by Cathay Pacific and the third party consultant. Previously, the selected stakeholder \\ngroups provided comments and ratings on different areas, including emerging issues \\nfacing the airline industry, perceptions on the current corporate social responsibility \\n(CSR) performance of Cathay Pacific and Dragonair and the expected response from \\nCathay Pacific, our reporting priorities, the stakeholder engagement approach taken by \\nCathay Pacific, and their views on Cathay Pacific’s Sustainable Development Strategy.\\nWith these comments and rating, we summarised stakeholders’ concerns into material \\nissues. For each of the material issues, we evaluated the impact of the issue to Cathay \\nPacific and produced a materiality matrix, which helps to structure our Sustainable \\nDevelopment Report for the year ended 31 December 2015.\\nFollowing the end of our five-year stakeholder engagement strategy in 2012, we carried \\nout a comprehensive survey in 2013/2014. The objectives of this exercise were to create \\na baseline and a set of metrics on the following:\\nMeasure stakeholder familiarity with Cathay Pacific initiatives and performance\\n•  Assess stakeholder perceptions\\n• \\n•  Determine stakeholder expectations\\n•  Evaluate Cathay Pacific strength and weakness\\nThe other objective is to develop actions based on these research findings.\\n\\nIdentify material issues for Cathay Pacific\\n\\nNote:\\n1.

       "'Sustainable Development Report 2015\\n \\n Together for Tomorrow\\n \\n Message from the Chief Executive\\n 2015 was a good year for Cathay Pacific. We recorded our best financial performance  \\n in the last five years, which was a tremendous achievement by the team especially  \\n under challenging circumstances. This year we made great strides revamping our  \\n brand philosophy, introduced new products and services, and advancing technological \\n innovation. I believe these efforts will really help lay a strong foundation to better position \\n ourselves for many years to come.\\n The industry in which we are operating remains challenging as a result of economic \\n outlook, volatility in fuel prices and increasing regulation. I see sustainability as a key \\n strategic value to help mitigate some of these risks, place us in a competitive position, \\n and providing us with the licence to grow in the future.\\n \\n “We want our business to be successful  \\n and we got to make it sustainable. I ask \\n everyone to be innovative and to contribute \\n to the environment and the future.”\\n Ivan Chu\\n Chief Executive\\n \\n 1\\n \\n \\x0cMessage from the Chief Executive\\n \\n 2015 was a landmark year, with the Climate Change Paris Agreement making a significant \\n statement and progress towards a solution to global climate change. We welcome the \\n call on governments and businesses to act on our collective responsibility. To that end, \\n we continued to invest in new fleet to make our airline as efficient as possible, which  \\n also helps minimise our carbon footprint. We also actively explore other avenues in \\n sustainable alternative fuel in order to reduce our reliance on the use of fossil-based fuel.\\n Last year, we retired less fuel efficient aircraft and worked closely with the manufacturer \\n and a supplier to embark on an innovative solution to recycle our A340s, where 90% of \\n the aircraft by weight could be recovered. We also introduced different ways to engage \\n our staff using internal social media platforms like Yammer to better facilitate dialogues \\n between staff, as well as a crowdsourcing platform that made it easier for staff to \\n contribute ideas on sustainability.\\n Looking ahead, 2016 promises to be an eventful year for us and the aviation industry.\\n We are very excited to be receiving the first batch of our new A350s. Not only do these \\n aircraft offer the latest advances in technology, operations, passenger comfort and \\n navigation, they will deliver a step change in efficiency and other environmental benefits. \\n This will really help us meet our carbon reduction objectives.\\n Another big occasion will be the ICAO’s 39th Assembly in autumn of 2016. All eyes will be \\n on ICAO to reach an agreement on the key construct of the Market-Based Measures to \\n cap aviation emissions at 2020 levels. International effort to agree and design the scheme \\n together has not been an easy process. I cannot stress enough the importance for  \\n all parties involved to work together to reach an agreement. If we fail, the uncertainty  \\n of a ‘patchwork’ of regulations globally will certainly make our industry less efficient  \\n and competitive.\\n Together, we have developed a strong capability in sustainability over the years and  \\n I look forward to the team continuing to make efforts against our strategy and carrying \\n on innovating and making our airline as sustainable as possible for tomorrow.\\n \\n Ivan Chu\\n Chief Executive\\n \\n Want to find out \\n more? Go to our \\n video on the right.\\n \\n Ivan Chu, Chief Executive, \\n talks about the latest Sustainable Development Report in this video. \\n \\n Our video, Working Towards a Sustainable Future, highlights what Cathay Pacific \\n is doing to make aviation more sustainable.\\n \\n 2\\n \\n Together for TomorrowCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cTogether for Tomorrow\\n \\n Together for Tomorrow\\n An Introduction to the Cathay Pacific  \\n Sustainable Development Report 2015\\n Sustainability has been a constant pursuit over the years at Cathay Pacific. We believe \\n sustainability is most successful when teams work together to achieve our common \\n long-term goals. Issues such as fuel efficiency can only really be tackled cross \\n departments with operations, engineering, product and services teams working on \\n related solutions. Our focus on staff engagement this year through IT platforms reflects \\n this ambition. Applications like Yammer and crowd sourcing tools allow us to break down \\n silos and enable us to work together more effectively.\\n Working together also extends to our partnerships and stakeholders outside of our \\n airline. This is why we continue to participate and stay in touch with industry associations, \\n governments, NGOs and the global community to address and solve problems our \\n industry faces\\n This year has seen a continuation in our sustainability efforts as we continue to make \\n steady steps to improve our efficiencies and reduce our impacts as well as making \\n inroads into better integrating and communicating our efforts.\\n Throughout this report you will find details of new initiatives that we have been pursing \\n over this past year together with new videos to tell our stories.\\n 2016 will mark a historic moment in aviation and environment with the ICAO Market-Based \\n Measures expected to be agreed, which will really be game changing in how we deal with \\n carbon emissions as an industry and as a company. As we continue to progress on our \\n commitments we are already laying the foundations for tomorrow’s challenges.\\n \\n “Sustainability is most successful when \\n teams work together to achieve our  \\n common long-term goals.”\\n John Slosar\\n Chairman\\n \\n 3\\n \\n Together for TomorrowCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cApproach to Sustainable Development\\n \\n Approach to Sustainable Development\\n Our Journey to Sustainable Development\\n Cathay Pacific has been enabling our customers to travel well for almost seven decades. \\n We want to be able to sustain our ability to provide such premium services for years  \\n to come. This means, amongst other things, using resources responsibly, being \\n purposeful in reducing the waste we produce, to foster meaningful collaborations,  \\n and be single-minded in fulfilling our commitments.\\n In 1980, Cathay Pacific became one of the first airlines in the world to implement fuel \\n efficiency measures – enabling us to undertake the first nonstop flight from Hong Kong \\n to London. We then implemented these on our long-haul routes beginning with our \\n nonstop flight from Hong Kong to Vancouver in 1982, and subsequently applied this \\n approach throughout our fleet and worldwide routes.\\n As part of the Swire Group, a statement in 1989 by our honorary life president and former \\n Chairman, Sir Adrian Swire, continues to inspire positive purpose in the company:\\n \\n “As a Group we should always seek to be \\n ahead of legislation rather than reacting to it: \\n that even if the environmentally “clean” way of \\n doing something is more expensive and \\n therefore on the face of it uneconomic, we \\n should always, regardless of mandatory \\n legislation, have a close look at the overall \\n feasibility of adopting such a practice, both \\n from the point of view of general public good \\n and enlightened self-interest.”\\n Sir Adrian Swire\\n Honorary life president and former Chairman\\n \\n This approach defines what sustainable development means to us – it is about applying \\n long term thinking in the business, doing the right thing by the environment and our \\n stakeholders, which results in long term success and a sustained existence.\\n Cathay Pacific’s current programme of CSR activities began back in 1991 with the launch \\n of Change for Good, although we already had community activities since the 1970’s, with \\n the purpose of giving back to Hong Kong and to the communities in which we operate.\\n \\n 4\\n \\n Together for TomorrowCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cApproach to Sustainable Development\\n \\n On employee remuneration, we became one of the first companies in Hong Kong to \\n provide flexible benefit schemes to our employees and formal management training \\n programmes for pilots, engineers and general managers.\\n In 1996, we became one of the first Hong Kong companies to publish a voluntary publicly \\n available Environmental Report for our stakeholders, which eventually evolved into our \\n first Sustainable Development Report in 2009.\\n In 2012, with the support of various departments, we launched our Sustainable \\n Development Strategy 20/20 commitments.\\n Thanks to the concerted effort of our colleagues, we were one of the few airlines and \\n Hong Kong companies to be listed simultaneously in the FTSE4Good, Dow Jones \\n Sustainability Index Asia-Pacific, and the Hang Seng Sustainability Index in 2013.  \\n We were also listed as a constituent of the Climate Disclosure Leadership Index Asia \\n ex-Japan category under the Carbon Disclosure Project.\\n Our journey has been full of challenges. Since 1980, we have experienced our record-\\n breaking profit years and our first profit loss; we have gone through Severe Acute \\n Respiratory Syndrome (SARS); a number of economic downturns; to record highs in Hong \\n Kong’s economy. Throughout this time, our sustainability commitments matured – from \\n focussing on environmental issues, to beginning to address social issues, to integrating \\n environmental, social and economic issues into our strategy.\\n This year’s report is testament to our continued efforts in ensuring Cathay Pacific stays \\n on the path to fully embedding the value and practice of sustainability into how we \\n conduct day-to-day business. We have made significant progress, but sustainability \\n issues have become far more complex, the solutions need to be more innovative, and  \\n the actions need to be taken more urgently.\\n \\n 5\\n \\n Together for TomorrowCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cApproach to Sustainable Development\\n \\n Sustainable Development Strategy\\n Cathay Pacific remains committed to maintaining a high standard of corporate governance \\n and devotes considerable effort to putting in place best practices in accordance with  \\n our Code of Conduct on Corporate Governance\\u2009\\n sustainable development within the Cathay Pacific Group is shown in this diagram:\\n \\n . The structure for governing \\n \\n The functions of these committees and working groups, as well as how we manage  \\n risks and ensure corporate compliance, are described in the Sustainability Governance \\n  of this report and the Corporate Governance Report in the Cathay Pacific \\n factsheet\\u2009\\n Airways Annual Report 2015 p.37-48.\\n \\n 6\\n \\n Together for TomorrowCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cApproach to Sustainable Development\\n \\n The Cathay Pacific Sustainable Development Strategy is designed to embed sustainability \\n into mainstream thinking of the company and hence in everything we do.\\n The development of the Strategy in 2009 resulted in five “priority areas” against which \\n different departments, business units and subsidiaries of Cathay Pacific have been \\n implementing sustainable development initiatives. These five priority areas enable us to \\n set specific targets and move purposefully toward our goal. They also encompass the \\n key components of who we are and how we work. In 2012, we launched our 20/20 SD \\n commitments, and each commitment is highlighted under each of the five priority areas.\\n \\n 7\\n \\n Together for TomorrowCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cApproach to Sustainable Development\\n \\n Our Sustainable Development Targets\\n Although the 20 commitments are being implemented by different business functions, \\n and, in turn, address different stakeholder priorities, they all promote Cathay Pacific’s \\n sustainable development targets which cut across the group’s activities and aim to:\\n a)  Reduce our overall emissions;\\n b)  Offer sustainably sourced products and services to our customers; and\\n c)  Ensure our community programmes are relevant and effective to the beneficiaries.\\n This is what the above three targets mean to us:\\n a)  Reducing Emissions\\n   According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the \\n International Energy Agency (IEA), aviation currently accounts for 2% of global \\n greenhouse gas emissions from human activity. As aviation grows to meet increasing \\n demand, the IPCC has forecasted that, by 2050, the industry’s greenhouse gas \\n emissions could rise to 3%. While forecasts for 2050 can vary significantly, they \\n highlight a challenge that the aviation industry will face over the next 40 years.\\n Projected increases in our emissions cannot be left unchecked, and that is why we \\n are firmly committed to reducing our impacts. The industry has directed significant \\n investment towards addressing the challenge, introducing new technology, better \\n operating procedures and sustainable biofuels.\\n \\n  \\n \\n   Within Cathay Pacific, aircraft emissions constitute 99% of our overall CO2 emissions. \\n \\n Therefore we have committed to manage our carbon emissions and contribute to \\n global efforts to reduce aviation’s impact on the environment and climate change.  \\n In fact, we commit to improving our fuel efficiency by 2% year on year to 2020,  \\n which is in line with ICAO’s target for the industry. At the same time, we are actively \\n managing the energy and water impacts of our facilities, vehicle fleet and the \\n equipment we use across our subsidiaries.\\n To learn more about our performance on this target, go to our Climate Change  \\n factsheet\\u2009\\n \\n .\\n \\n  \\n \\n 8\\n \\n Together for TomorrowCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cApproach to Sustainable Development\\n \\n b)  Offering Sustainably Sourced Products and Minimising Resource Use\\n   We continually examine options to reduce resource use throughout our supply chain \\n and to use materials from sustainable sources (such as Forestry Stewardship Council \\n and Marine Stewardship Council-certified products, or recycled materials). We ensure \\n our procurement team understand the requirements of our Supply Chain Sustainability \\n Code of Conduct, so they can, in turn, ensure our suppliers comply with our standards. \\n We also look for opportunities to improve recycling and waste management across  \\n all facets of our operations. These include products and services provided inflight and \\n at airport lounges, back office operations and the maintenance, repair and overhaul \\n (MRO) process of our aircraft.\\n To learn more about our performance on this target, go to our Waste Management \\n factsheet\\u2009\\n \\n , Sustainable Sourcing factsheet\\u2009\\n \\n  and Biodiversity factsheet\\u2009\\n \\n .\\n \\n  \\n \\n c)  Ensuring the Effectiveness of Community Programmes\\n   We support and invest in the Hong Kong community, of which we have been a part for \\n more than six decades. Local staff members are also active in community initiatives in \\n the outport countries where we have a presence.\\n \\n   Since 2011, we began making reference to the internationally-recognised London \\n Benchmarking Group (LBG) methodology in evaluating one of our flagship projects, \\n English On Air. English On Air provides English-speaking opportunities for young \\n Hong Kong residents. The LBG methodology involves assessing how our goals align \\n with beneficiaries’ needs and expectations. We aim to ensure that our community \\n programmes truly respond to their needs and play to our strengths.\\n \\n   Our global community investment strategy is to leverage the resources of our \\n company and to motivate our staff and passengers to address the needs of the \\n communities we serve, focusing mainly on three areas: youth and education, medical \\n care and environmental conservation.\\n \\n   Apart from our work in Hong Kong, we strongly encourage our outport staff to get \\n \\n involved in their local communities and to proactively identify appropriate NGO \\n partners with a view to exploring cooperation opportunities that will benefit the  \\n local community.\\n To learn more about our performance on this target, go to our Community Investment \\n factsheet\\u2009\\n \\n  and Our People factsheet\\u2009\\n \\n .\\n \\n  \\n \\n 9\\n \\n Together for TomorrowCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cApproach to Sustainable Development\\n \\n Our 20/20 Sustainability Commitments\\n In 2010, we developed our Sustainable Development Strategy. In 2012, we launched our \\n vision for how this Strategy will be realised through 20 commitments, to help us define \\n what we intend to do and achieve by 2020. These commitments encompassed the key \\n operational areas of our business, right across our flights, catering services, ground fleet, \\n offices, suppliers and the communities we fly to. This is the result of years of engagement \\n with our key stakeholders: our employees, passengers, investors, company management, \\n community neighbours, subject experts and academics. \\n \\n CX Commitments\\u2002\\n Commitments by 2020\\n 2% year-on-year improvement in fuel efficiency\\n Develop a cost-effective strategy to incorporate sustainable aviation fuel \\n into our operations\\n Embed climate change adaptation into overall risk management\\n Reduce electricity use by 25%\\n Ground vehicles to use alternative fuels/power source\\n All Cathay Pacific Group-owned buildings, offices and lounges will consider \\n green building standards or principles\\n Offer carbon offsetting as part of all ticket-related marketing and \\n promotional activities\\n Develop and implement a sustainable cargo policy \\n All meals served inflight and on the ground will meet sustainability criteria\\n Reduce the environmental impact of maintenance, repair and overhauls \\n (MRO) carried out in Hong Kong by 50% \\n Reduce material usage and waste by 25%\\n Increase recycling by 25%\\n All Cathay Pacific Group-branded materials will be produced using \\n sustainable materials\\n All paper, paper products and textiles offered to customers or as part of the \\n service offering will be made of sustainable materials\\n Engage with suppliers of inflight sales products on sustainability principles\\n All suppliers will comply with our Supply Chain Code of Conduct\\n All meals served inflight and on the ground will meet sustainability criteria\\n CX Holidays to offer at least five more ecotourism packages by 2015\\n All holiday packages offered by CX Holidays will be verified for their \\n sustainability impacts\\n Implement London Benchmarking Group (LBG) methodology to evaluate \\n major company community projects\\n Implement CX community investment guidelines by 2015\\n \\n * Baseline is 2009 unless otherwise indicated.\\n \\n Section of the Report to  \\n which this issue relates to\\n \\n Climate Change\\n \\n Biodiversity\\n \\n Waste Management\\n \\n Sustainable Sourcing\\n \\n Sustainable Sourcing\\n Biodiversity\\n \\n Sustainable Sourcing\\n \\n Sustaining a Life Well \\n Travelled/Sustainable \\n Development Strategy\\n \\n 10\\n \\n Together for TomorrowCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cApproach to Sustainable Development\\n \\n Evolution of Our Approach to Reporting\\n Since 2012, our SD report has been structured according material issues in response  \\n to stakeholder needs.

However strong competition, a significant reduction in  \\n fuel surcharges, unfavourable foreign currency movements and a higher proportion  \\n of passengers were connecting through Hong Kong put downward pressure on yield. \\n Congestion at Hong Kong International Airport and air traffic control constraints in the \\n Greater China region also weighed down on our operating expenses.\\n Throughout the year, Economy class demand was strong. Premium class demand \\n improved on regional routes but was not as strong as expected on some long-haul routes. \\n Air cargo demand weakened from the second quarter and remained lacklustre for the \\n rest of the year.\\n We continued to invest heavily in our products and brands and in the development of  \\n our network. New or refurbished lounges were opened in Hong Kong, Manila, Bangkok, \\n San Francisco and Taipei. Four new destinations joined our network for a total of 179 \\n destinations in 43 countries and territories. One Cathay Pacific aircraft was repainted  \\n in our new livery.\\n Hong Kong has been our home for nearly 70 years and we remain deeply committed to \\n strengthening the city as an aviation hub.

Our goal is to manage the risks of the operation to As Low As Reasonably \\n Practical (ALARP) in order to allow the company to pursue and maintain its commercial \\n activities in a sustainable way.\\n Our Safety Policy, signed by the Chief Executive, clearly articulates this commitment  \\n by stating that “safety is our number-one priority” and that we are “fully committed to \\n providing a safe operational and working environment” for all our passengers and staff.  \\n It goes on to state that “ultimate accountability rests with me as Chief Executive. However, \\n responsibility for safety lies with each and every one of us in the airline”.\\n We have well-developed and deeply-embedded proactive safety systems to ensure that \\n we can deliver the results. Developments made in 2015 will ensure that we live up to these \\n exacting standards.\\n \\n “If we don’t know where the risks lie, we can’t \\n mitigate them effectively.”\\n Richard Howell\\n General Manager Corporate Safety and Security\\n \\n 1\\n \\n \\x0cUpdates for 2015\\n \\n Updates for 2015\\n Group Safety Integration\\n The Corporate Safety departments of Cathay Pacific and Dragonair were merged in two \\n stages under one General Manager. The objective of this merger was to create a single \\n Group Safety department, enabling the better sharing of resources and expertise across \\n both operations. The integrated approach across both airlines ensures that functions  \\n are aligned to support a common purpose and outcomes, such as safety governance \\n structures, training and communications, risk management processes and performance \\n monitoring. The merger also introduces opportunities to become more efficient, \\n consolidating and focusing resources on common safety issues and avoiding duplication \\n of effort in safety management. Furthermore, centralised administrative activities leave \\n more time to focus on proactive safety interventions.\\n IATA Enhanced International Operational Safety Audit\\n Following Cathay Pacific’s completion of an IATA Enhanced International Operational \\n Safety Audit in 2014, Dragonair successfully completed its first Enhanced IOSA achieving \\n zero findings in December 2015. Cathay Pacific aims to renew its Enhanced IOSA \\n accreditation in June 2016.\\n Airbus A350 Entry into Service Preparation\\n As the first airline to deploy its pilots to fly both the Airbus A330 and A350 from the  \\n start of the A350 operation under a single licence, Cathay Pacific has been proactively \\n managing the risks associated with the entry into service of the A350 since 2014. A full \\n risk assessment, approved by the Hong Kong CAD, was completed for this activity. Extra \\n mitigations that go beyond those recommended by Airbus have been implemented to \\n ensure that the A350 joins the Cathay fleet in a carefully managed way.\\n Mental Health of Flight Crew\\n Following the tragic loss of 150 people on Germanwings Flight 9525, our Corporate \\n Medical Department initiated a review of pilot hiring and medical screening practices,  \\n as well as reviewing work conducted at an international level. It was determined that  \\n the airline’s current processes and mitigations for addressing mental health issues are \\n appropriate. Furthermore, we developed a random Alcohol and Drug testing programme \\n which will be implemented in November 2016 for roll out not just to pilots but to all \\n safety-sensitive staff, including cabin crew and load controllers.\\n \\n 2\\n \\n SafetyCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cUpdates for 2015\\n \\n Ban on Hoverboards in Passenger Luggage and Carry on\\n Following reports from various sources, including one incident involving another airline  \\n of a hoverboard battery causing a fire during inspection, we conducted a thorough risk \\n assessment of this emerging hazard. Subsequently, a risk-based decision was made to \\n implement a total ban on the carriage of these lithium battery powered hoverboards in \\n passenger cabin and check-in baggage for both Cathay Pacific and Dragonair.\\n Cultivating a Strong Reporting Culture\\n In order to facilitate a strong reporting culture, which is a sign of a healthy safety culture, \\n Cathay Pacific and Dragonair staff are encouraged to report freely to the company. This \\n would help facilitate safety actions for the benefit of learning and improving the overall \\n safety of operations. A flow of safety reports generally demonstrates an excellent active \\n reporting culture.\\n During the past five years, the number of Ground Safety Reports received by the Group \\n Safety Department, for both Cathay Pacific and Dragonair operations, has increased due \\n to two main drivers:\\n a)  a move from primarily paper-based reporting to electronic channels; and\\n b)  a substantial increase in the reporting of hazards and insignificant risk occurrences.\\n The improved intelligence provided by the reports has become a key driver in the Cathay \\n Pacific and Dragonair safety management system development.\\n Cathay Pacific and Dragonair always target zero accidents. In 2015, with approximately \\n 34 million passengers carried, there were no events classified as an accident. There were \\n no staff fatalities and zero serious work-related injuries in 2015. The total number of lost \\n time injuries reduced by 25.5% year-on-year.\\n \\n 3\\n \\n SafetyCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cUpdates for 2015\\n \\n To manage and mitigate potential injures, a three year programme of proficiency based \\n manual handling training with the renowned Pristine Condition, a specialist in OH&S from \\n the UK, was commenced in 2015. This programme targets three staff groups, namely \\n cabin crew, Hong Kong International Airport terminal staff and Hong Kong Airport Services \\n staff who handle bags, mail and cargo on a daily basis. In addition to the lifting injuries \\n seen in the airport terminal, the training also addresses slips and trips which are also \\n prevalent there. A wider slips and trips and manual handling awareness campaign ran \\n throughout 2015 for all staff based in Hong Kong.\\n Other initiatives and training were conducted in various departments across the company. \\n At Cathay City, our Hong Kong headquarters, our facilities management company carried \\n out a Fire, Health and Safety Audit along with routine air quality surveys. A Group Safety \\n monthly newsletter continued in 2015 and included a regular section on OHS reminders \\n to staff.\\n Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate\\n \\n l\\n \\n r\\n a\\n e\\n y\\n /\\n s\\n e\\n e\\n y\\n o\\n p\\n m\\n e\\n 0\\n 0\\n 1\\n  \\n r\\n e\\n p\\n s\\n e\\n i\\n r\\n u\\n n\\n \\n j\\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n I\\n \\n 2015\\n \\n 2014\\n \\n 2013\\n \\n 2.69\\n 2.69\\n 2.81\\n \\n 3.00\\n \\n 3.48\\n \\n 3.72\\n \\n 4.36\\n \\n 3.81\\n \\n 4\\n \\n 5.32\\n \\n 5\\n \\n 6\\n \\n 0\\n 1\\n Subsidiary Staff\\n \\n 2\\n \\n 3\\n \\n KA\\n \\n CX\\n \\n •  LTIFR is computed as (total injuries multiplied by 200,000 and then divided by the total \\n •  The factor 200,000 is annual hours worked by 100 employees, based on 40 hours per \\n \\n hours worked\\n week for 50 weeks a year).\\n \\n 4\\n \\n SafetyCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cWhat Our Stakeholders Think\\n \\n What Our Stakeholders Think\\n Our stakeholders continue to view customer safety and staff OHS as the top issues \\n relevant to Cathay Pacific. The consistent message we have been receiving over the \\n years is that both staff and passengers regard Cathay Pacific as having good safety \\n performance, records and contingency plans, with strong emphasis on passenger and \\n staff safety. In particular, staff are proud of the safety culture, and feel that the company \\n is able to communicate effectively on safety issues. Cathay Pacific is also one of the first \\n airlines to implement a Fatigue Risk Management System. This work is on-going and we \\n will continue to build on what we have achieved.\\n \\n 5\\n \\n SafetyCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cOur Safety Commitments\\n \\n Want to find out  \\n more?

To support its plan to replace 25% of its diesel Lower \\n Deck Loader fleet with electric ones before 2020, HAS also introduced 10 electric Lower \\n Deck Loaders in 2015.\\n \\n At Vogue Laundry, consumption of the dry cleaning solvent, perchloroethylene, was \\n increased by 23.0% in 2015 owing to an increase in the number of items for dry cleaning. \\n Vogue also switched from diesel boiler to a dual fuel boiler utilising Towngas and ultra-low \\n sulphur diesel at a 90:10 ratio, which helped reduce CO2 emissions. In addition, three \\n Euro II trucks were disposed.\\n CPCS replaced air-cooled chillers with two efficient water-cooled ones, fitted two heat \\n pumps, and continued installing LED lights around the premise, which resulted in an \\n estimated total saving of 4,977 tonnes of carbon in 2015.\\n Cathay Pacific continued to be included in the FTSE4Good Index, one of the most \\n recognised sustainability indices measuring the performance of companies demonstrating \\n strong environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices. We also supported the \\n HKSAR Government’s Carbon Footprint Repository for the second year, which was newly \\n developed for listed companies in Hong Kong, by disclosing our emissions data through \\n this system.

We recognise the impacts of using and disposing of these \\n materials, such as the shortage of landfill space in Hong Kong. Therefore we have \\n medium to long-term programmes in place to minimise these impacts and be \\n responsible stewards of these resources. While we were seen by our stakeholders as \\n having improved in this area, they expect to see continued action on this urgent issue.\\n In particular, our staff are concerned about what they can do in the working environment, \\n for example, flight and cabin crew wanted to see more being done to tackle inflight waste, \\n while our ground staff wanted to see us take more proactive steps in offices and airports. \\n This is a positive sign, as we are seeing our staff more willing to be involved in reducing our \\n use of resources and increasing recycling and re-using where we can. This is encouraging \\n as many of our resource and waste management initiatives can only be achieved with the \\n support of our staff, both inflight and on the ground.\\n In recent years, we have received considerable attention on our use of plastics inflight –  \\n this was consistent amongst our different stakeholders – from passengers, staff and \\n   \\n environmental organisations. We have provided a detailed section in our factsheet\\u2009\\n on our plastic use.\\n Our strategy to resource use and waste management is as follows:\\n \\n 1\\n \\n \\x0cUpdates for 2015\\n \\n Updates for 2015\\n In the past few years, we have initiated a number of resource use and waste management \\n initiatives with a full list detailed in the factsheet\\u2009\\n We are constantly examining options whereby we can reduce resource use and waste,  \\n or use materials from more sustainable sources. Below are a number of initiatives which \\n progressed in 2015:\\n •  We began to retire our fleet of 11 Airbus A340s. Under Airbus’ PAMELA initiative \\n (Process for Advanced Management of End-of-Life Aircraft), the aircraft were \\n systematically recycled where up to 90% of their components can be reused, \\n recovered, or recycled. Four aircraft were retired and recycled in 2015. The remaining \\n seven A340s will be retired by the end of 2017.\\n \\n .\\n \\n •  Trials for donating surplus food and beverages from inbound flights became a regular \\n occurrence. 116 tonnes of food were donated in 2015 to a food bank in Hong Kong.\\n •  Paper saving initiatives involving process improvements and making better use of \\n •  Maps of Hong Kong International Airport distributed with our boarding passes to \\n \\n technology resulted in savings of over 220,000 sheets at Cathay Pacific.\\n \\n passengers were switched to FSC paper.\\n \\n Recycling\\n We continued with recycling initiatives inflight as well as in the offices, covering \\n aluminium cans, plastic bottles, cups, and glass bottles.\\n Recycling from inbound Cathay Pacific flights in 2015 consisted of:\\n •  Aluminium cans: 21,255 kg\\u2009\\n •  Plastic bottles: 20,496 kg\\u2009\\n •  Plastic cups: 14,975 kg\\u2009\\n •  Glass bottles: 488,096 kg\\u2009\\n \\n 2\\n \\n Waste ManagementCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cUpdates for 2015\\n \\n Inflight Waste Recycling (Kg)\\n \\n Cathay Pacific commenced inflight glass recycling on 1 September 2011.\\n \\n Aircraft\\n With 11 A340-300s due to be retired by 2017, we began working with a company \\n specialising in end-of-life solutions to recycle these aircraft. Four of our A340s, each \\n weighing 125 tonnes, were retired and transferred to a workshop in France to be actively \\n recycled. Under Airbus’ PAMELA initiative (Process for Advanced Management of \\n End-of-Life Aircraft), the aircraft were systematically recycled where up to 90% of their \\n components can be reused, recovered, or recycled.

We recognise that food \\n waste is unavoidably created every day through our operations. We have implemented  \\n a number of measures to reduce food waste where we can, such as reusing food offcuts, \\n recycling used cooking oil, donating surplus meat and vegetables from Cathay City to \\n the food rescue programme Food Angel, and better flight meal planning.\\n Launched in the last quarter of 2014, trials for donating unopened juices, cereals, and \\n pre-packaged food from inbound flights became a regular occurrence. Cathay Pacific \\n Volunteers were mobilised to support this initiative jointly organised by Cathay Pacific \\n Catering Services Limited and Feeding Hong Kong, a local food bank. In 2015, 60 welfare \\n centres received 116,000 kg of food and beverages.\\n \\n “Inevitably we upload more food and \\n beverages onboard than needed, to ensure \\n our passengers get sufficient choice.

We envision a sustainable supply chain within the \\n Cathay Pacific Group, and working with our suppliers is key to delivering products \\n and services to our customers sustainably.\\n We work with our suppliers on a supply chain sustainability compliance process as part \\n of our risk management process. Many of our suppliers are companies that also report \\n publicly on their sustainability performance and hold similar values towards corporate \\n responsibility as ourselves.\\n \\n 1\\n \\n \\x0cSustainable Sourcing Matters\\n \\n In order to deliver products and services that are sustainably sourced, we need to work \\n with our suppliers. Developing a sustainable supply chain is a challenge due to the large \\n amount of items we purchase, each with varying specifications. In some cases, we may \\n not have leverage on all our suppliers and have limited influence on the sustainability \\n attributes of these materials. Moreover, our specifications need to meet very strict safety \\n standards, particularly if we are taking these items onboard. We are determined to find \\n solutions to these challenges:\\n •  We participate in best practice sharing sessions locally and internationally: Since \\n 2007 Cathay Pacific has been a member of the Swire Sustainable Purchasing Working \\n Group, which looks at synergies within the Swire Group in embedding sustainable \\n purchasing practices in the Swire Pacific companies. We were a founding member  \\n of the Hong Kong Green Purchasing Charter in 2008. In 2013, we were also one  \\n of the founding participants of the inaugural Sustainable Lifestyles Working Group \\n launched by non-profit sustainability organisation Business for Social Responsibility \\n and sustainability communications firm Futerra. In 2015, the oneworld Procurement \\n Best Practises Working Group – CSR was established to understand how each \\n member airline currently manages sustainability risk in their supply chains and  \\n share best practises.\\n \\n •  We trial and use alternative materials and implement these across the Cathay Pacific \\n Group: We often assess the performance of alternative materials. Once it passes  \\n the trial phase, we implement the material across the whole Group. For example, when \\n we decided to switch all office paper to sustainably- sourced material, we assessed \\n different options from recycled paper to paper made from FSC sources. Since our \\n initial purchase of sustainable office paper in 2008, currently the majority of office \\n paper, marketing collaterals in Hong Kong, training materials, inflight magazines and \\n team newsletters have switched to FSC or recycled paper.\\n \\n 2\\n \\n Sustainable SourcingCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cSustainable Sourcing Matters\\n \\n Sustainable Purchasing\\n Our purchasing practices are of the highest professional and ethical standards. Most of \\n the purchasing requirements for both Cathay Pacific and Dragonair are managed by the \\n Procurement & Aircraft Trading Department. We require the procurement of all goods  \\n to be undertaken with full compliance to the applicable laws, tax regime and regulations \\n that govern the specific transaction with full cognisance taken of our Anti-Bribery, \\n Anti-Trust and Data Protection policies.\\n We aim to encourage our suppliers to improve on their sustainability practices through \\n capacity building and sharing knowledge on best practices as part of our approach  \\n to sustainable procurement. Our purchasing teams understand the need to consider \\n sustainable purchasing and responsible supply chain practices in buying decisions.  \\n We require our suppliers to provide clear, accurate and appropriate reporting of their \\n progress in achieving our Supply Chain Sustainability Code of Conduct objectives.\\n Supply Chain Sustainability Code of Conduct\\n Since the launch of our Supply Chain Sustainability Code of Conduct in 2007, suppliers \\n to Cathay Pacific must provide clear, accurate and appropriate reporting of their \\n progress toward achieving our objectives contained in this Code.

For many years, we have \\n been sponsoring habitat-protection programmes within Asia, and working with NGOs from \\n across the region. For instance, working with Friends of the Earth, we provided funding \\n that resulted in the planting of 10,000 tree seedlings around Hong Kong. We also raised \\n nearly HK$8 million from passengers to support conservation initiatives in mainland China \\n through The Nature Conservancy. Partnering with the Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Gardens \\n in Hong Kong, we helped reintroduce 609 endangered pig-nosed turtles to Indonesia  \\n by donating cargo space and air tickets to the organisation. Since at least 2009, Cathay \\n Pacific has been engaging with shark conservation specialists and organisations to \\n understand the issue and explore our role as a responsible business. We are one of the \\n first airlines in the world to raise the awareness of the unsustainability of the global shark \\n trade. We will continue to direct investments in biodiversity conservation as a way to give \\n back to the community.\\n \\n 1\\n \\n \\x0cBiodiversity Matters\\n \\n It is important that our inflight meals are sustainably sourced as well. On average,  \\n Cathay Pacific and Dragonair serve 110,155 inflight meals everyday to our passengers. \\n Therefore, by adhering to international sustainability standards, we can have a substantial \\n positive impact on the diversity of a wide variety of ecosystems. We have already \\n adopted a Sustainable Food Policy that does not allow the serving of a number of \\n unsustainably produced food items, including shark fin soup, both inflight and at \\n company-paid functions. Since 2011, we have been serving fish from sustainable \\n sources, such as those that are Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certified, in Economy \\n Class on all our flights departing from Europe. We follow a similar policy for fish served  \\n in Economy Class on flights from Australian and North American ports.\\n To learn more about what the Cathay Pacific Group has been doing to support  \\n habitat-protection programs and adopt a strategy that incorporates biodiversity \\n considerations into our daily operations, go to our Biodiversity factsheet\\u2009\\n \\n .\\n \\n 2\\n \\n BiodiversityCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cUpdates for 2015\\n \\n Stop Fish Bombing! Finally, \\n there is a way to stop it | \\n Dynamite Fishing\\n \\n Updates for 2015\\n Cathay Pacific delivered an endangered Sumatran rhino, Harapan, safely from the  \\n United States to his indigenous home in Indonesia. With fewer than 100 of these animals \\n remaining in the wild in the world, Harapan was transported back to the Sumatran Rhino \\n Sanctuary for breeding and conservation purposes. Harapan was accompanied by a \\n veteran animal keeper during the 16,000-kilometre journey. In preparation, the 816-kilogram \\n rhino underwent medical checks and was trained to walk into and voluntarily remain in his \\n crate. In addition, we assisted the Toronto Zoo by shipping boots and filtration equipment \\n to rhino conservation rangers in Indonesia free of charge.\\n In addition to adhering to the Convention on International Trade and Endangered Species \\n (CITES) requirements on the transport of endangered animals and plants listed under \\n Appendices 1 and 2 of the Convention, we placed an embargo on the transportation of  \\n a) hunting trophies; and b) racing greyhounds (exporting from Australia to any destination \\n and importing to Hong Kong from any place of origins).\\n In early 2015, we started supporting the work of Stop Fish Bombing!, a non-profit \\n organisation based in Hong Kong that incorporates a Silicon Valley-based technology \\n company and a TV production company in Malaysia. Stop Fish Bombing! is working with \\n governments, local authorities, NGOs, and the private sector to develop underwater \\n bomb detection technology against fish bombing and raise public aware on this issue.\\n In mid-2015, an acceptance procedure for shark and shark-related products was  \\n issued to all Cathay Pacific and Dragonair ports. Requests for the shipment of shark  \\n or shark products were required to be assessed by an external expert panel of two  \\n highly respected international shark conservation agencies, in accordance with the \\n sustainability of the species, before they could be considered for carriage.\\n \\n 3\\n \\n BiodiversityCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cWhat Our Stakeholders Think\\n \\n What Our Stakeholders Think\\n Today, companies are increasingly expected to understand their biodiversity impact  \\n and to determine ways to protect and enhance biodiversity as part of their business \\n operations.

Identified Sustainability Information  The Identified Sustainability Information for the year ended 31 December 2015 is summarised below:  1) Greenhouse Gases (“GHG”) emissions data  Aircraft operations \\uf0b7 Carbon Dioxide (CO2)  Unit of measure Tonnes Other operations \\uf0b7 CO2 emission from electricity \\uf0b7 CO2 emission from ground vehicles \\uf0b7 CO2 emission from town gas Unit of measure Tonnes Tonnes Tonnes  2) Selected quantitative data \\uf0b7 The mathematical accuracy of the grammes/ATK and grammes/RTK computation for 2015 (to be used by the Company to determine fuel efficiency).  \\uf0b7 Outcome of the Fly greener programme in 2015: (i)  the total number of offsets for staff travelling on business, and  (ii) the total number of offsets bought by passengers.  \\uf0b7 Weight  of recycled material from inbound Hong Kong Cathay Pacific flights:  - Aluminium cans (kg) - Plastic cups (kg) - Plastic bottles (kg) - Glass bottles (kg)  \\uf0b7 Amount of recycled material from Cathay Pacific City and Dragonair House:  - Paper and cardboard (kg) - Aluminium cans (kg) - Plastic (kg) - Printer cartridges (pieces) (Note: Cathay Pacific City and Dragonair House combined figure)  \\uf0b7 Data regarding the English on Air (“EOA”) programme during the 2014/2015 academic year: “A total of 168 students from five schools in Tung Chung participated in the English on Air programme during the 2014/2015 academic year.”  \\uf0b7 Data regarding the food donation programme during 2015: “60 welfare centres received 116,000 kg of food and beverages.”  Our assurance was with respect to the year ended 31 December 2015 information only and we have not performed any procedures with respect to earlier periods or any other elements included in the Sustainable Development Report 2015 and, therefore, do not express any conclusion thereon. Cathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cIndependent Assurance Statement\\n \\n 3\\n \\n About this Report  2   Criteria  The criteria used by the Company to prepare the Identified Sustainability Information is set out under the heading “Reporting Methodology” in the section “About this Report” of the Sustainable Development Report 2015 at www.cathaypacific.com/sdreport (the “Criteria”).  The Company’s Responsibility for the Identified Sustainability Information  The Company is responsible for the preparation of the Identified Sustainability Information in accordance with the Criteria. This responsibility includes the design, implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation of Identified Sustainability Information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.  Inherent limitations  The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-financial information allows for different, but acceptable, measures and measurement techniques and can affect comparability between entities. In addition, GHG quantification is subject to inherent uncertainty because of incomplete scientific knowledge used to determine emissions factors and the values needed to combine emissions of different gases.  Our Independence and Quality Control  We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour.   Our firm applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.  Our Responsibility  Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the Identified Sustainability Information based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained. We conducted our limited assurance engagement in accordance with (i) International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised), Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, for selected quantitative data, and, (ii) International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3410, Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements, for GHG emissions data, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. These standards require that we plan and perform this engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the Identified Sustainability Information is free from material misstatement.  A limited assurance engagement involves assessing the suitability in the circumstances of the Company’s use of the Criteria as the basis for the preparation of the Identified Sustainability Information, assessing the risks of material misstatement of the Identified Sustainability Information whether due to fraud or error, responding to the assessed risks as necessary in the circumstances, and evaluating the overall presentation of the Identified Sustainability Information. A limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in relation to both the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal control, and the procedures performed in response to the assessed risks.  The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment and included inquiries, observation of processes performed, inspection of documents, analytical procedures, evaluating the Cathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cIndependent Assurance Statement\\n \\n 4\\n \\n About this Report  3  appropriateness of quantification methods and reporting policies, and agreeing or reconciling with underlying records.  Given the circumstances of the engagement, in performing the procedures listed above we:  \\uf0b7 Made inquiries of relevant management of the Company; \\uf0b7 Understood the process for collecting and reporting the Identified Sustainability Information; \\uf0b7 Undertook analytical procedures over the Identified Sustainability Information; \\uf0b7 Performed limited substantive testing on a selective basis of the Identified Sustainability Information; and \\uf0b7 Considered the disclosure and presentation of the Identified Sustainability Information.  The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had we performed a reasonable assurance engagement. Accordingly, we do not express a reasonable assurance opinion about whether the Company’s Identified Sustainability Information has been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria.  Limited Assurance Conclusion  Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Company’s Identified Sustainability Information for the year ended December 31, 2015 is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria.  Our report has been prepared for and only for the board of directors of the Company and for no other purpose.

Limited (CPCS)\\n •  Cathay Pacific Services Limited (CPSL)\\n •  Hong Kong Airport Services Limited (HAS)\\n •  Vogue Laundry Service Limited (VLS)\\n •  AHK Air Hong Kong Limited (AHK) (60% owned)\\n Other principal subsidiaries and associates, as outlined on pages 98 to 99 of the Cathay \\n Pacific Group 2015 Annual Report that are not included within the scope of this report, \\n will be considered for inclusion in the future.\\n Operational Boundaries\\n The operational boundaries for the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions are as follows:\\n •  Scope 1 – Direct GHG emission, including global CO2 emissions from flights, ground \\n •  Scope 2 – Electricity and Towngas (production) indirect GHG emissions\\n The reporting period of the GHG data is the twelve-month period of 1 January to  \\n 31 December 2015. The year 2009 has been used as the base year for comparing the \\n emissions profile of our flights in line with our 20/20 commitments. However, we continue \\n to provide information from 1998 to ensure consistency with our previous reporting. \\n Please note there have been changes in organisation and operational boundaries over \\n the years which may impact comparability.\\n \\n vehicles and Towngas combustion\\n \\n 7\\n \\n About this Report Cathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cReporting Methodology\\n \\n Scope 1 Emissions\\n Scope 1 emissions include fuel and Towngas usage from ground-based activities in \\n Hong Kong covering Cathay Pacific and the subsidiaries. In Hong Kong, the CO2 emission \\n factors used follow the guidelines published by the Environmental Protection Department \\n (EPD) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HK SAR) Government in February \\n 20101. For CO2 emission factors for outport data, references have been made to the \\n International Energy Agency (2010)2.\\n In respect of our GHG emissions from aircraft fuel consumption, our scope includes  \\n all flight activities, including testing, training flights, dry lease and wet lease. As fuel \\n density varies according to a number of factors, we use the Joint Inspection Group’s3 \\n recommended specific gravity of 0.80 kg/L to calculate the weight of fuel. We use the \\n IPCC’s emission factor of 3.154 to determine CO2 emissions from the combustion of \\n aircraft fuel.\\n Scope 2 Emissions\\n Our scope includes electricity consumption and Towngas production for our operations \\n in Hong Kong covering Cathay Pacific and the subsidiaries. Emission factors used in our \\n scope follow the guidelines published by the EPD of the HK SAR Government in February \\n 2010, the International Energy Agency (2010), and the relevant utilities.\\n For GHGs, other than CO2, others including CH4, N2O, PFCs and SFs are either not \\n applicable or not material to the overall GHG reporting.\\n Towngas is also used in the Cathay Pacific canteen. As this is operated by a third party, \\n consistent with the previous year, it is specifically excluded.\\n Methodologies Used to Calculate or Measure Emissions\\n Refer to Endnote References.\\n \\n 8\\n \\n About this Report Cathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cReporting Methodology\\n \\n Other Indicators\\n Environmental Indicators\\n The scope of this year’s reported resource usage includes operations in Hong Kong \\n covering Cathay Pacific, the 100% and 60% owned subsidiaries, energy consumption \\n and greenhouse gas data from four outports (Auckland, Taipei, Manila and San Francisco) \\n and non-GHG data from five outports (Frankfurt, Paris, Karachi, Kuala Lumpur and Sydney) \\n which were able to provide auditable numbers. We will continue to work on increasing the \\n scope to cover all major outports in future reports.\\n Social Indicators\\n Operations in Hong Kong covering Cathay Pacific and the 100% and 60% owned \\n subsidiaries are included on the Social Indicators table.\\n GRI Content Index\\n The GRI Content Index is prepared with reference to the GRI G4 Guidelines ‘in accordance \\n option’ Core. The GRI Content Index does not reflect actual implementation of Cathay \\n Pacific’s sustainable development initiatives nor the value or quality of the report and  \\n its content.\\n Other Matters\\n FLY greener Offsets\\n FLY greener offsets are calculated as the tonnes of CO2 purchased by all passengers \\n (including staff), using either cash or Air Miles as a method of payment. One tonne  \\n of CO2 had a cash price of HK$25.51 in 2015. The average Air Miles price was 626  \\n Air Miles per tonne of CO2 during the year ended 31 December 2015. The total tonnage \\n was computed based on the amount paid during the year. Cash received during the year \\n related to flights taken in 2015.\\n Fuel Efficiency\\n Fuel efficiency is calculated as fuel usage per available tonne kilometre (ATK). ATK is \\n defined in the Cathay Pacific Airways Limited Annual Report 2015 as overall capacity, \\n measured in tonnes available for the carriage of passengers, excess baggage, cargo  \\n and mail on each sector multiplied by the sector distance.\\n RTK is defined as traffic volume, measured in load tonnes from the carriage of passengers, \\n excess baggage, cargo and mail on each sector multiplied by the sector distance.\\n The fuel consumption figure shown on the Environmental Indicators Table only includes \\n Cathay Pacific and Dragonair for comparability with last year’s report.\\n ATK of 30,048 million and RTK of 22,220 million used in this calculation are taken from \\n the Cathay Pacific Airways Limited Annual Report 2015.\\n \\n 9\\n \\n About this Report Cathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cReporting Methodology\\n \\n Recycled Materials\\n In 2015, materials recycled from inbound flights to Hong Kong include plastic cups; \\n plastic bottles; aluminium cans; and glass bottles. Materials recycled by the Cathay \\n Pacific Airways and 100% owned subsidiaries include paper and cardboard, plastics, \\n aluminium cans, waste lubrication oil, glass bottles and printer cartridges from Cathay \\n Pacific City; and paper and cardboard, aluminium cans, plastic and printer cartridges \\n from Dragonair House. The amount of recycled materials refers to those recorded in \\n either recycling vendor invoices or internal tracking records.\\n Food Donation\\n In 2015, unconsumed food items such as unopened juices, cereals, and pre-packaged \\n food from Cathay Pacific inbound flights to Hong Kong were collected for donation to  \\n a local food bank. The amount of donated food and beverages refers to those in the \\n tracking records of the local food bank.\\n English on Air\\n English on Air is an educational programme which involves English-speaking Cathay \\n Pacific staff volunteers from a wide variety of nationalities and backgrounds who \\n encourage local students to speak English. Participating students are invited to Cathay \\n Pacific City to meet and chat with volunteers during English-speaking sessions.\\n London Benchmarking Group\\n The London Benchmarking Group model is used by companies to assess and report on \\n the value and achievements of their corporate community investment. It takes the form \\n of a matrix that helps to summarise, and quantify, the achievements of a community \\n activity. It breaks down the elements of the activity, detailing the different inputs, then \\n going on to establish the outputs and, eventually, the impacts that these have achieved.\\n We evaluated the effectiveness of our English on Air activities run during the academic \\n year 2014/2015 with reference to the London Benchmarking Group model. We developed \\n questionnaires covering the areas indicated below and conducted surveys with the \\n participating students and teachers in order to develop a scorecard of these areas.\\n •  Leverage company resources\\n •  English opportunities\\n • \\n Increase confidence\\n •  School partnership\\n •  Awareness of aviation and Cathay Pacific Airways\\n \\n 10\\n \\n About this Report Cathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cReporting Methodology\\n \\n Materiality Matrix\\n The materiality matrix plots our corporate social responsibilities issues in two dimensions: \\n the importance of the issue to our stakeholders and the impact of the issue to Cathay \\n Pacific.  In order to develop this, we have been engaging with a third party consultant \\n since 2006 to perform focus groups and interviews with selected groups of stakeholders, \\n chosen by Cathay Pacific and the third party consultant. Previously, the selected stakeholder \\n groups provided comments and ratings on different areas, including emerging issues \\n facing the airline industry, perceptions on the current corporate social responsibility \\n (CSR) performance of Cathay Pacific and Dragonair and the expected response from \\n Cathay Pacific, our reporting priorities, the stakeholder engagement approach taken by \\n Cathay Pacific, and their views on Cathay Pacific’s Sustainable Development Strategy.\\n With these comments and rating, we summarised stakeholders’ concerns into material \\n issues. For each of the material issues, we evaluated the impact of the issue to Cathay \\n Pacific and produced a materiality matrix, which helps to structure our Sustainable \\n Development Report for the year ended 31 December 2015.\\n Following the end of our five-year stakeholder engagement strategy in 2012, we carried \\n out a comprehensive survey in 2013/2014. The objectives of this exercise were to create \\n a baseline and a set of metrics on the following:\\n Measure stakeholder familiarity with Cathay Pacific initiatives and performance\\n •  Assess stakeholder perceptions\\n • \\n •  Determine stakeholder expectations\\n •  Evaluate Cathay Pacific strength and weakness\\n The other objective is to develop actions based on these research findings.\\n \\n Identify material issues for Cathay Pacific\\n \\n Note:\\n 1.

       "'Sustainable Development Report 2015  Together for Tomorrow  Message from the Chief Executive 2015 was a good year for Cathay Pacific. We recorded our best financial performance   in the last five years, which was a tremendous achievement by the team especially   under challenging circumstances. This year we made great strides revamping our   brand philosophy, introduced new products and services, and advancing technological  innovation. I believe these efforts will really help lay a strong foundation to better position  ourselves for many years to come. The industry in which we are operating remains challenging as a result of economic  outlook, volatility in fuel prices and increasing regulation. I see sustainability as a key  strategic value to help mitigate some of these risks, place us in a competitive position,  and providing us with the licence to grow in the future.  “We want our business to be successful   and we got to make it sustainable. I ask  everyone to be innovative and to contribute  to the environment and the future.” Ivan Chu Chief Executive  1  \\x0cMessage from the Chief Executive  2015 was a landmark year, with the Climate Change Paris Agreement making a significant  statement and progress towards a solution to global climate change. We welcome the  call on governments and businesses to act on our collective responsibility. To that end,  we continued to invest in new fleet to make our airline as efficient as possible, which   also helps minimise our carbon footprint. We also actively explore other avenues in  sustainable alternative fuel in order to reduce our reliance on the use of fossil-based fuel. Last year, we retired less fuel efficient aircraft and worked closely with the manufacturer  and a supplier to embark on an innovative solution to recycle our A340s, where 90% of  the aircraft by weight could be recovered. We also introduced different ways to engage  our staff using internal social media platforms like Yammer to better facilitate dialogues  between staff, as well as a crowdsourcing platform that made it easier for staff to  contribute ideas on sustainability. Looking ahead, 2016 promises to be an eventful year for us and the aviation industry. We are very excited to be receiving the first batch of our new A350s. Not only do these  aircraft offer the latest advances in technology, operations, passenger comfort and  navigation, they will deliver a step change in efficiency and other environmental benefits.  This will really help us meet our carbon reduction objectives. Another big occasion will be the ICAO’s 39th Assembly in autumn of 2016. All eyes will be  on ICAO to reach an agreement on the key construct of the Market-Based Measures to  cap aviation emissions at 2020 levels. International effort to agree and design the scheme  together has not been an easy process. I cannot stress enough the importance for   all parties involved to work together to reach an agreement. If we fail, the uncertainty   of a ‘patchwork’ of regulations globally will certainly make our industry less efficient   and competitive. Together, we have developed a strong capability in sustainability over the years and   I look forward to the team continuing to make efforts against our strategy and carrying  on innovating and making our airline as sustainable as possible for tomorrow.  Ivan Chu Chief Executive  Want to find out  more? Go to our  video on the right.  Ivan Chu, Chief Executive,  talks about the latest Sustainable Development Report in this video.   Our video, Working Towards a Sustainable Future, highlights what Cathay Pacific  is doing to make aviation more sustainable.  2  Together for TomorrowCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cTogether for Tomorrow  Together for Tomorrow An Introduction to the Cathay Pacific   Sustainable Development Report 2015 Sustainability has been a constant pursuit over the years at Cathay Pacific. We believe  sustainability is most successful when teams work together to achieve our common  long-term goals. Issues such as fuel efficiency can only really be tackled cross  departments with operations, engineering, product and services teams working on  related solutions. Our focus on staff engagement this year through IT platforms reflects  this ambition. Applications like Yammer and crowd sourcing tools allow us to break down  silos and enable us to work together more effectively. Working together also extends to our partnerships and stakeholders outside of our  airline. This is why we continue to participate and stay in touch with industry associations,  governments, NGOs and the global community to address and solve problems our  industry faces This year has seen a continuation in our sustainability efforts as we continue to make  steady steps to improve our efficiencies and reduce our impacts as well as making  inroads into better integrating and communicating our efforts. Throughout this report you will find details of new initiatives that we have been pursing  over this past year together with new videos to tell our stories. 2016 will mark a historic moment in aviation and environment with the ICAO Market-Based  Measures expected to be agreed, which will really be game changing in how we deal with  carbon emissions as an industry and as a company. As we continue to progress on our  commitments we are already laying the foundations for tomorrow’s challenges.  “Sustainability is most successful when  teams work together to achieve our   common long-term goals.” John Slosar Chairman  3  Together for TomorrowCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cApproach to Sustainable Development  Approach to Sustainable Development Our Journey to Sustainable Development Cathay Pacific has been enabling our customers to travel well for almost seven decades.  We want to be able to sustain our ability to provide such premium services for years   to come. This means, amongst other things, using resources responsibly, being  purposeful in reducing the waste we produce, to foster meaningful collaborations,   and be single-minded in fulfilling our commitments. In 1980, Cathay Pacific became one of the first airlines in the world to implement fuel  efficiency measures – enabling us to undertake the first nonstop flight from Hong Kong  to London. We then implemented these on our long-haul routes beginning with our  nonstop flight from Hong Kong to Vancouver in 1982, and subsequently applied this  approach throughout our fleet and worldwide routes. As part of the Swire Group, a statement in 1989 by our honorary life president and former  Chairman, Sir Adrian Swire, continues to inspire positive purpose in the company:  “As a Group we should always seek to be  ahead of legislation rather than reacting to it:  that even if the environmentally “clean” way of  doing something is more expensive and  therefore on the face of it uneconomic, we  should always, regardless of mandatory  legislation, have a close look at the overall  feasibility of adopting such a practice, both  from the point of view of general public good  and enlightened self-interest.” Sir Adrian Swire Honorary life president and former Chairman  This approach defines what sustainable development means to us – it is about applying  long term thinking in the business, doing the right thing by the environment and our  stakeholders, which results in long term success and a sustained existence. Cathay Pacific’s current programme of CSR activities began back in 1991 with the launch  of Change for Good, although we already had community activities since the 1970’s, with  the purpose of giving back to Hong Kong and to the communities in which we operate.  4  Together for TomorrowCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cApproach to Sustainable Development  On employee remuneration, we became one of the first companies in Hong Kong to  provide flexible benefit schemes to our employees and formal management training  programmes for pilots, engineers and general managers. In 1996, we became one of the first Hong Kong companies to publish a voluntary publicly  available Environmental Report for our stakeholders, which eventually evolved into our  first Sustainable Development Report in 2009. In 2012, with the support of various departments, we launched our Sustainable  Development Strategy 20/20 commitments. Thanks to the concerted effort of our colleagues, we were one of the few airlines and  Hong Kong companies to be listed simultaneously in the FTSE4Good, Dow Jones  Sustainability Index Asia-Pacific, and the Hang Seng Sustainability Index in 2013.   We were also listed as a constituent of the Climate Disclosure Leadership Index Asia  ex-Japan category under the Carbon Disclosure Project. Our journey has been full of challenges. Since 1980, we have experienced our record- breaking profit years and our first profit loss; we have gone through Severe Acute  Respiratory Syndrome (SARS); a number of economic downturns; to record highs in Hong  Kong’s economy. Throughout this time, our sustainability commitments matured – from  focussing on environmental issues, to beginning to address social issues, to integrating  environmental, social and economic issues into our strategy. This year’s report is testament to our continued efforts in ensuring Cathay Pacific stays  on the path to fully embedding the value and practice of sustainability into how we  conduct day-to-day business. We have made significant progress, but sustainability  issues have become far more complex, the solutions need to be more innovative, and   the actions need to be taken more urgently.  5  Together for TomorrowCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cApproach to Sustainable Development  Sustainable Development Strategy Cathay Pacific remains committed to maintaining a high standard of corporate governance  and devotes considerable effort to putting in place best practices in accordance with   our Code of Conduct on Corporate Governance\\u2009 sustainable development within the Cathay Pacific Group is shown in this diagram:  . The structure for governing   The functions of these committees and working groups, as well as how we manage   risks and ensure corporate compliance, are described in the Sustainability Governance   of this report and the Corporate Governance Report in the Cathay Pacific  factsheet\\u2009 Airways Annual Report 2015 p.37-48.  6  Together for TomorrowCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cApproach to Sustainable Development  The Cathay Pacific Sustainable Development Strategy is designed to embed sustainability  into mainstream thinking of the company and hence in everything we do. The development of the Strategy in 2009 resulted in five “priority areas” against which  different departments, business units and subsidiaries of Cathay Pacific have been  implementing sustainable development initiatives. These five priority areas enable us to  set specific targets and move purposefully toward our goal. They also encompass the  key components of who we are and how we work. In 2012, we launched our 20/20 SD  commitments, and each commitment is highlighted under each of the five priority areas.  7  Together for TomorrowCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cApproach to Sustainable Development  Our Sustainable Development Targets Although the 20 commitments are being implemented by different business functions,  and, in turn, address different stakeholder priorities, they all promote Cathay Pacific’s  sustainable development targets which cut across the group’s activities and aim to: a)  Reduce our overall emissions; b)  Offer sustainably sourced products and services to our customers; and c)  Ensure our community programmes are relevant and effective to the beneficiaries. This is what the above three targets mean to us: a)  Reducing Emissions   According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the  International Energy Agency (IEA), aviation currently accounts for 2% of global  greenhouse gas emissions from human activity. As aviation grows to meet increasing  demand, the IPCC has forecasted that, by 2050, the industry’s greenhouse gas  emissions could rise to 3%. While forecasts for 2050 can vary significantly, they  highlight a challenge that the aviation industry will face over the next 40 years. Projected increases in our emissions cannot be left unchecked, and that is why we  are firmly committed to reducing our impacts. The industry has directed significant  investment towards addressing the challenge, introducing new technology, better  operating procedures and sustainable biofuels.       Within Cathay Pacific, aircraft emissions constitute 99% of our overall CO2 emissions.   Therefore we have committed to manage our carbon emissions and contribute to  global efforts to reduce aviation’s impact on the environment and climate change.   In fact, we commit to improving our fuel efficiency by 2% year on year to 2020,   which is in line with ICAO’s target for the industry. At the same time, we are actively  managing the energy and water impacts of our facilities, vehicle fleet and the  equipment we use across our subsidiaries.

We ensure  our procurement team understand the requirements of our Supply Chain Sustainability  Code of Conduct, so they can, in turn, ensure our suppliers comply with our standards.  We also look for opportunities to improve recycling and waste management across   all facets of our operations. These include products and services provided inflight and  at airport lounges, back office operations and the maintenance, repair and overhaul  (MRO) process of our aircraft.

Local staff members are also active in community initiatives in  the outport countries where we have a presence.    Since 2011, we began making reference to the internationally-recognised London  Benchmarking Group (LBG) methodology in evaluating one of our flagship projects,  English On Air. English On Air provides English-speaking opportunities for young  Hong Kong residents. The LBG methodology involves assessing how our goals align  with beneficiaries’ needs and expectations. We aim to ensure that our community  programmes truly respond to their needs and play to our strengths.    Our global community investment strategy is to leverage the resources of our  company and to motivate our staff and passengers to address the needs of the  communities we serve, focusing mainly on three areas: youth and education, medical  care and environmental conservation.    Apart from our work in Hong Kong, we strongly encourage our outport staff to get   involved in their local communities and to proactively identify appropriate NGO  partners with a view to exploring cooperation opportunities that will benefit the   local community.

In 2012, we launched our  vision for how this Strategy will be realised through 20 commitments, to help us define  what we intend to do and achieve by 2020. These commitments encompassed the key  operational areas of our business, right across our flights, catering services, ground fleet,  offices, suppliers and the communities we fly to. This is the result of years of engagement  with our key stakeholders: our employees, passengers, investors, company management,  community neighbours, subject experts and academics.

This stakeholder- and issue-focussed and performance-based  approach aligns with our SD strategy and reflects what is important to our business and  stakeholders, and what impact our company.  A detailed assessment was conducted on the findings of past years’ engagement  exercises. We then draw on our regular stakeholder engagement exercises to monitor  current priorities and emerging issues. Although the importance of certain issues, such  as waste management, sustainable sourcing and biodiversity, has increased over the  years, some of the topics such as climate change have remained high as stakeholders’  priorities over the years.

This compares to a profit of HK$3,150 million in 2014. The Group’s financial performance in 2015 was better than in 2014, with the business  benefiting from low fuel prices. However strong competition, a significant reduction in   fuel surcharges, unfavourable foreign currency movements and a higher proportion   of passengers were connecting through Hong Kong put downward pressure on yield.  Congestion at Hong Kong International Airport and air traffic control constraints in the  Greater China region also weighed down on our operating expenses. Throughout the year, Economy class demand was strong. Premium class demand  improved on regional routes but was not as strong as expected on some long-haul routes.  Air cargo demand weakened from the second quarter and remained lacklustre for the  rest of the year. We continued to invest heavily in our products and brands and in the development of   our network. New or refurbished lounges were opened in Hong Kong, Manila, Bangkok,  San Francisco and Taipei. Four new destinations joined our network for a total of 179  destinations in 43 countries and territories. One Cathay Pacific aircraft was repainted   in our new livery. Hong Kong has been our home for nearly 70 years and we remain deeply committed to  strengthening the city as an aviation hub. Supported by our world-class team and strong  financial position, we are confident of longer-term success and will continue to invest  into our future to sustain a life well travelled for our passengers.  1  \\x0cOverview of 2015  Key Investor and Business Sustainability Recognition in 2015:  Principal Subsidiaries and Associates Please refer to p.98-99 of our Annual Report for the full list.  2  2015 ProgressCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cOverview of 2015  Financial and Operational HK$6,000 million Attributable profit 34.0% Proportion of fuel cost in relation to our total operating cost 34.1 million Number of passengers carried by Cathay Pacific and Dragonair Cathay Pacific is one of a handful of companies in Hong Kong to be on the  FTSE4Good and the Hang Seng Sustainability Index at the same time.

In 2012, we launched our  vision for how this Strategy will be realised through 20 commitments, to help us define  what we intend to do and achieve by 2020. These commitments encompassed the key  operational areas of our business, right across our flights, catering services, ground fleet,  offices, suppliers and the communities we fly to. This is the result of years of  engagement with our key stakeholders: our employees, passengers, investors, company  management, community neighbours, subject experts and academics.

At Cathay Pacific, we have a longstanding and clear focus on safety that is embedded in  the organisation. Our goal is to manage the risks of the operation to As Low As Reasonably  Practical (ALARP) in order to allow the company to pursue and maintain its commercial  activities in a sustainable way. Our Safety Policy, signed by the Chief Executive, clearly articulates this commitment   by stating that “safety is our number-one priority” and that we are “fully committed to  providing a safe operational and working environment” for all our passengers and staff.   It goes on to state that “ultimate accountability rests with me as Chief Executive. However,  responsibility for safety lies with each and every one of us in the airline”. We have well-developed and deeply-embedded proactive safety systems to ensure that  we can deliver the results. Developments made in 2015 will ensure that we live up to these  exacting standards.  “If we don’t know where the risks lie, we can’t  mitigate them effectively.” Richard Howell General Manager Corporate Safety and Security  1  \\x0cUpdates for 2015  Updates for 2015 Group Safety Integration The Corporate Safety departments of Cathay Pacific and Dragonair were merged in two  stages under one General Manager. The objective of this merger was to create a single  Group Safety department, enabling the better sharing of resources and expertise across  both operations. The integrated approach across both airlines ensures that functions   are aligned to support a common purpose and outcomes, such as safety governance  structures, training and communications, risk management processes and performance  monitoring. The merger also introduces opportunities to become more efficient,  consolidating and focusing resources on common safety issues and avoiding duplication  of effort in safety management. Furthermore, centralised administrative activities leave  more time to focus on proactive safety interventions. IATA Enhanced International Operational Safety Audit Following Cathay Pacific’s completion of an IATA Enhanced International Operational  Safety Audit in 2014, Dragonair successfully completed its first Enhanced IOSA achieving  zero findings in December 2015. Cathay Pacific aims to renew its Enhanced IOSA  accreditation in June 2016. Airbus A350 Entry into Service Preparation As the first airline to deploy its pilots to fly both the Airbus A330 and A350 from the   start of the A350 operation under a single licence, Cathay Pacific has been proactively  managing the risks associated with the entry into service of the A350 since 2014. A full  risk assessment, approved by the Hong Kong CAD, was completed for this activity. Extra  mitigations that go beyond those recommended by Airbus have been implemented to  ensure that the A350 joins the Cathay fleet in a carefully managed way. Mental Health of Flight Crew Following the tragic loss of 150 people on Germanwings Flight 9525, our Corporate  Medical Department initiated a review of pilot hiring and medical screening practices,   as well as reviewing work conducted at an international level. It was determined that   the airline’s current processes and mitigations for addressing mental health issues are  appropriate. Furthermore, we developed a random Alcohol and Drug testing programme  which will be implemented in November 2016 for roll out not just to pilots but to all  safety-sensitive staff, including cabin crew and load controllers.  2  SafetyCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cUpdates for 2015  Ban on Hoverboards in Passenger Luggage and Carry on Following reports from various sources, including one incident involving another airline   of a hoverboard battery causing a fire during inspection, we conducted a thorough risk  assessment of this emerging hazard. Subsequently, a risk-based decision was made to  implement a total ban on the carriage of these lithium battery powered hoverboards in  passenger cabin and check-in baggage for both Cathay Pacific and Dragonair. Cultivating a Strong Reporting Culture In order to facilitate a strong reporting culture, which is a sign of a healthy safety culture,  Cathay Pacific and Dragonair staff are encouraged to report freely to the company. This  would help facilitate safety actions for the benefit of learning and improving the overall  safety of operations. A flow of safety reports generally demonstrates an excellent active  reporting culture. During the past five years, the number of Ground Safety Reports received by the Group  Safety Department, for both Cathay Pacific and Dragonair operations, has increased due  to two main drivers: a)  a move from primarily paper-based reporting to electronic channels; and b)  a substantial increase in the reporting of hazards and insignificant risk occurrences. The improved intelligence provided by the reports has become a key driver in the Cathay  Pacific and Dragonair safety management system development. Cathay Pacific and Dragonair always target zero accidents. In 2015, with approximately  34 million passengers carried, there were no events classified as an accident. There were  no staff fatalities and zero serious work-related injuries in 2015. The total number of lost  time injuries reduced by 25.5% year-on-year.  3  SafetyCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cUpdates for 2015  To manage and mitigate potential injures, a three year programme of proficiency based  manual handling training with the renowned Pristine Condition, a specialist in OH&S from  the UK, was commenced in 2015. This programme targets three staff groups, namely  cabin crew, Hong Kong International Airport terminal staff and Hong Kong Airport Services  staff who handle bags, mail and cargo on a daily basis. In addition to the lifting injuries  seen in the airport terminal, the training also addresses slips and trips which are also  prevalent there. A wider slips and trips and manual handling awareness campaign ran  throughout 2015 for all staff based in Hong Kong. Other initiatives and training were conducted in various departments across the company.  At Cathay City, our Hong Kong headquarters, our facilities management company carried  out a Fire, Health and Safety Audit along with routine air quality surveys. A Group Safety  monthly newsletter continued in 2015 and included a regular section on OHS reminders  to staff.

The consistent message we have been receiving over the  years is that both staff and passengers regard Cathay Pacific as having good safety  performance, records and contingency plans, with strong emphasis on passenger and  staff safety. In particular, staff are proud of the safety culture, and feel that the company  is able to communicate effectively on safety issues. Cathay Pacific is also one of the first  airlines to implement a Fatigue Risk Management System. This work is on-going and we  will continue to build on what we have achieved.  5  SafetyCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cOur Safety Commitments  Want to find out   more?

More than ever, we have both the economic and environmental incentives to implement  more sustainable solutions to address our environmental impact such as fuel efficiency,  new fleet and sustainable biofuels. We are also active in international negotiations on developing a global market-based  measure for reducing emissions from aviation from 2020. We agree with our stakeholders that climate change is the company’s highest environmental  priority and challenge, and that we need to manage our long term impacts in innovative  ways. We recognised this in the 1990s, when we released our first Environmental Report,  ,  and reinforced that position in 2006 when we launched our Climate Change Position\\u2009 one of the first few airlines to have done so publicly.   1  \\x0cClimate Change Matters  Key CX Climate Change Initiatives from the 1980s to Current 1980 1990  Aircraft weight reduction task force Supports the Swire Group Environmental Policy  First environmental report including CO2 emissions Received ISO 14001 certification  Early 1980s 1989  1996 1997  2005   2006 2007 2008  2009  Established the Climate Change Long Term   Action Group Initiated engine core washing Launched Cathay Pacific’s Climate Change Position Launched carbon offset programme – FLY greener Joined Climate Change Business Forum Founded the Aviation Global Deal Joined the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Users Group Supported IATA’s climate change commitments  Developed a sustainable biofuel strategy Supports climate change monitoring with IAGOS  Cathay Pacific commits to a CO2 target  Cathay Pacific is a member of the GMTF Cathay Pacific invests in a biofuel developer  2000  2011 2012 2014  2  Climate ChangeCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cClimate Change Matters  Exceeding Industry Target We have committed ourselves to a target of a 2% year-on-year improvement of CO2  emissions per passenger and cargo we carry (known as “revenue tonne kilometre”, or  RTK) by 2020, based on 2009 levels.

Over the same period, an increase of 8% and 4% were recorded for passengers and  cargo carried respectively. Our fuel efficiency improved by 1.2% and 2.7% in relation   to capacity (available tonne kilometre, ATK) and traffic carried (revenue tonne kilometre,  RTK) respectively over 2014. This brought our total fuel efficiency improvement since  1998 to 16.3% and 24.8% per ATK and RTK respectively.  17.3million tonnes  CO2 emissions   from fuel burn    SCOPE 1 EMISSIONS   17,368,305 tonnes    (99.50%)   Aviation Fuel, Fuel    Combustion and Towngas    SCOPE 2 EMISSIONS   86,289 tonnes    (0.5%)   Electricity and Towngas  Fuel efficiency achievements in 2015 included: •  Fleet modernisation by taking delivery of three Airbus A330-300s and six Boeing  •   777-300ERs. Four Airbus A340-300s and four Boeing 747-400s were retired. In December 2015, operational approval was granted by the Hong Kong Civil Aviation  Department (HKCAD) for the eEnabled System fitted onboard our Boeing 777-300ERs.  Activation of the system on the first 11 aircraft is expected to be completed by  January 2016.  •  Each eEnabled aircraft will have its paper charts, manuals, and documents, which   can weigh up to 51 kg, replaced with the Electronic Flight Bag and Electronic TechLog.  New antennas on the aircraft also significantly reduce aircraft drag thereby reducing  the fuel burn.  4  Climate ChangeCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cUpdates for 2015     In addition to weight and fuel savings, the eEnabled Aircraft solution will bring many  benefits including: ○   Improving the speed, accuracy, deployment and presentation of information  between the aircraft and ground infrastructure, enabling improvements to  operational efficiency, maintenance effectiveness and service delivery.  ○  Enabling pilots to determine precise fuel requirements and the potential for   increased payload for each flight.  ○  Reducing the environmental impact of producing, distributing and disposing of  operations manuals and charts and decreasing the weight of carrying these on  the aircraft.  ○  Enabling earlier preparation and faster action by ground engineers, with less time   spent retrieving and analysing information from paper technical and cabin logs.    We will continue to roll out the eEnabled System across our fleet of Boeing 777, Airbus  A330, and Boeing 747 freighter aircraft. The A330s and A320/A321s in the passenger  fleet of Dragonair will also have the new technology installed progressively.  •  The Flight Efficiency Working Group was established in 2014 to facilitate a  coordinated approach to managing our fuel use better and improving fuel efficiency.  The cross-departmental team focussed on projects in the following areas: ○  Aircraft operations ○  Aircraft weight ○  Aircraft performance ○  Airspace efficiency  5  Climate ChangeCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cUpdates for 2015        Trials were conducted on lowering the window blinds during disembarkation to reduce  the rate of temperature increase in the aircraft cabin by up to 3-4 °C per hour. If the  temperature increase rate is slowed down, the pilots are able to delay the start of the  auxiliary power units (which uses jet fuel) and as such conserve energy whilst  maintaining a comfortable environment in the cabin for our crew and passengers. In order to conduct more advanced analytics that will help to guide our future efficiency  initiatives, we entered a five-year agreement with Rolls-Royce to collect flight data.  Flight data of 188 aircraft operated by Cathay Pacific and Dragonair will be analysed  to further optimise our growing operations.

When production begins, the plant will convert more than 163,000 tonnes of  prepared municipal solid waste feedstock into approximately 12 million gallons per year  of renewable synthetic crude oil that will be further refined into low carbon jet fuel. We have negotiated a long-term supply agreement with Fulcrum for an initial 375 million  US gallons of sustainable aviation fuel over 10 years and which would meet all the airline’s  technical requirements, specifications and sustainability criteria. According to Fulcrum, jet fuel produced by their waste-to-fuels process will reduce  lifecycle carbon emissions when used in aircraft or road transport by more than 80%  when compared to traditional fuels derived from crude oil and other fossil sources.   This process also reduces the amount of municipal solid waste destined for landfill   and resulting methane gas emissions. In spite of the low fuel price environment, Cathay Pacific remains committed to the biofuel  agenda as part of our long term strategy to reducing our climate change impact.  7  Climate ChangeCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cUpdates for 2015  ICAO Global Market-Based Measure In 2014, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) began the development   of a global market-based measure (MBM) to address the growth of international   aviation emissions. The Global Market-based Measure Technical Task Force (GMTF), comprising  representatives and experts from ICAO member states, industry and NGOs, was  convened. Cathay Pacific is a member of the GMTF and has been actively engaged   in the dialogue on the implementation of a global MBM for aviation emissions under  ICAO, including membership of IATA’s advisory group on this issue. We are part of a small group of IATA carriers that are members of the expert groups looking  at specific technical aspects of a global MBM through the ICAO Advisory Committee on  Environmental Protection (CAEP), together with NGOs, states and academia. Significant progress was made in 2015 on defining the technical details of the MBM  scheme. The momentum is set to continue with additional meetings planned leading up to  the next ICAO Assembly in 2016 and we will continue to play an active role in the process. Global Efforts by the Aviation Industry in Reducing Emissions 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014/  2015  The 38th ICAO Assembly agreed to proceed with the  development of a global market-based measure for   international aviation industry emissions  The aviation industry committed to new and ambitious targets  for emissions reductions through IATA  CCTF completed extensive work around the implementation   of CNG 2020  Cathay Pacific as a Founding member of the Aviation Global   Deal Group  GMTF and working group meetings to discuss details   of the global MBM  Cathay Pacific appointed to IATA Climate Change Task Force  Monitoring of CO2 data began in compliance with the EUETS  8  Climate ChangeCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cUpdates for 2015  European Union Emissions Trading Scheme The European Union continued to ‘stop the clock’ on the EU Emissions Trading Scheme  (ETS). The revised regulation extended the suspension of the ETS with respect to flights  to and from non-European Economic Area (EEA) countries until 2016, as well as requiring  Member States to report on how they used revenue from ETS allowance auctions. Although Cathay Pacific welcomed the clarity this provided airlines for the next three  years, the continual amendments to the regulation added to legislative uncertainty.  Nonetheless, we remained in full compliance with the EU ETS regulation, but our  commitment is towards seeking a global MBM solution that is fair, equitable and avoids  market distortion as opposed to regional schemes such as the EU ETS. The verification of our 2015 emissions data by an external auditor was completed in  February 2016 and our emissions report was submitted to the UK Environment Agency   in the same month. Contributing to Climate Change Science Since 2013, one of our Airbus A330-300 aircraft equipped with In-service Aircraft for a  Global Observing System (IAGOS) scientific instruments has operated over 1,400 flights  primarily on Australian and Middle East routes from Hong Kong, complementing five  other similarly equipped commercial aircraft operating on other routes around the world.  Data on ozone, carbon monoxide, water vapour, and clouds is recorded during take-off,  cruising, and landing and transmitted to the IAGOS central database on a daily basis for  access by science and policy users, including the provision of real time data for weather  prediction, air quality forecasting and climate models. The growing IAGOS database will  continue to improve our understanding of cloud processes and their impact on climate. Between 2012 and 2014, data covering 74,759 clouds sampled during 4,399 IAGOS  flights yielded new insights into our understanding of small cirrus ice crystals and their  implications for flight operations. The findings1 revealed that the safety of an aircraft   may be affected when flying through clouds with very high ice crystal concentrations,  where instrument interference can cause anomalous readings from temperature and  airspeed sensors.   1  Beswick, Karl, Darrel Baumgardner, Martin Gallagher, Graciela B.

This amounted to 3,300 tCO2  in 2015. Cathay Pacific and Dragonair also offset the    at an approximate   CO2 impacts of staff travelling on business, totaling 12,300 tCO2 cost of HK$268,000. The programme portfolio was renewed and features two new projects in China and  Taiwan. Both projects are certified to the Gold Standard. Clean and Efficient Cooking and Heating Project, China Located in the rural areas of Shanxi Province, China, this fuel-switching project reduces  greenhouse gases (GHGs) by replacing coal with renewable biomass on a household  level. More than 7,000 inefficient coal burning stoves are replaced with highly efficient  ones that use agricultural residue, which are currently burned in the fields as waste. The  GHG reductions are approximately 82,000 tonnes per year as well as improved indoor air  quality as less fumes are produced from more efficient combustion. By using agricultural  waste as a source of fuel, families are also saving on fuel spending, allowing for better  use of family income.  10  Climate ChangeCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cUpdates for 2015  InfraVest Changbin and Taichung Bundled Wind Farms Project, Taiwan Two wind farms consisting of 65 wind turbines along the west coast of Taiwan generate  clean electricity equivalent to 110,000 households’ annual demand annually. The project  reduces GHG emissions by 370,000 tonnes per year and helps to improve local air quality  through reduced air pollutants such as sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. This project  has created a number employment opportunities in support of the operation of the wind  farms. Increased public interest in the wind farms inspired guided tours of the facility.  Clean and Efficient Cooking   and Heating Project Shanxi, China  Taiwan Changbin and    Taichung Wind Farm Project Taiwan  Hong Kong International Airport Expansion Following the issuance of the Environmental Permit for the expansion of Hong Kong  International Airport in November 2014, the HKSAR Government’s Executive Council  approved the project in March 2015.   11  Climate ChangeCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cUpdates for 2015  Ground Operations In 2015, the total electricity consumption at Cathay City and Dragonair House were  35,446,467 kWh  and 7,043,874 kWh  respectively, representing a decrease of 0.9%   and increase of 0.3% respectively. We continue to invest in energy saving measures   such as chilled water system optimisation and LED lighting replacement. The incremental  increase in consumption at Dragonair House was mainly due to increased training and  recruitment activities. To support staff driving electric vehicles to work, we designated a parking space at  Cathay City next to the electric vehicle charging point for electric vehicles only. Three  further outdoor EV chargers were installed in 2015. At the Cathay Pacific Cargo Terminal, energy saving initiatives introduced in 2015, including  the introduction of solar-powered passenger steps and electric vehicles, optimisation   of cargo and passenger elevators, installation of induction lamps and LED lights, and  circuitry modifications with timers, reduced electricity usage per tonnage by 13.6%  against 2014.  After successfully implementing a water-to-water heat pump system at The Bridge,   a similar system is being applied at The Pier to reduce our energy usage. The First Class  lounge reopened in June 2015 whilst the Business Class lounge is expected to reopen in  the second quarter of 2016.  12  Climate ChangeCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cUpdates for 2015  Our subsidiary businesses, including HAS, Vogue Laundry and Cathay Pacific Catering  Services (CPCS), have been replacing existing equipment with newer, more efficient and  lower emission models. HAS, our ground handling company, continued with the second term of their three-year  Ground Support Equipment (GSE) Replacement Programme, replacing 26 aged and less  fuel-efficient GSE and vehicles. To support its plan to replace 25% of its diesel Lower  Deck Loader fleet with electric ones before 2020, HAS also introduced 10 electric Lower  Deck Loaders in 2015.  At Vogue Laundry, consumption of the dry cleaning solvent, perchloroethylene, was  increased by 23.0% in 2015 owing to an increase in the number of items for dry cleaning.  Vogue also switched from diesel boiler to a dual fuel boiler utilising Towngas and ultra-low  sulphur diesel at a 90:10 ratio, which helped reduce CO2 emissions. In addition, three  Euro II trucks were disposed. CPCS replaced air-cooled chillers with two efficient water-cooled ones, fitted two heat  pumps, and continued installing LED lights around the premise, which resulted in an  estimated total saving of 4,977 tonnes of carbon in 2015. Cathay Pacific continued to be included in the FTSE4Good Index, one of the most  recognised sustainability indices measuring the performance of companies demonstrating  strong environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices. We also supported the  HKSAR Government’s Carbon Footprint Repository for the second year, which was newly  developed for listed companies in Hong Kong, by disclosing our emissions data through  this system. Cathay Pacific obtained an ‘AA’ rating under the Hang Seng Corporate  Sustainability Index.   13  Climate ChangeCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cWhat Our Stakeholders Think  What Our Stakeholders Think Not surprisingly, climate change, carbon emissions and energy efficiency remain the  primary environmental issues of focus for stakeholders, and with fuel as an important  emerging issue, due to their perceived high impact on our business – high fuel costs,  increasing regulations such as the emergence of different Emissions Trading Schemes,  the development of a global market-based measure, and impact on the environment.   In particular, there are expectations on role that biofuels will play in helping us achieve  our emissions goal. Climate change has been a material issue for us for a long time, and  stakeholders recognise that we have been addressing this as a priority, but at the same  time, expect us to adopt targets that exceed the industry ones. There is an expectation for us to further enhance transparency and communication  around our climate change approach, especially with staff, and for us to engage more  proactively and publicly on this issue.  14  Climate ChangeCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cOur Climate Change Commitments  Our Climate Change Commitments CX Commitments\\u2002 In 2012, we launched our commitments under our Sustainable Development Strategy.

Climate ChangeCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cSustainable Development Report 2015  Waste Management  Waste Management Matters The use of material resources such as paper and wood, plastic and food in our  operations is inevitable. We recognise the impacts of using and disposing of these  materials, such as the shortage of landfill space in Hong Kong. Therefore we have  medium to long-term programmes in place to minimise these impacts and be  responsible stewards of these resources. While we were seen by our stakeholders as  having improved in this area, they expect to see continued action on this urgent issue. In particular, our staff are concerned about what they can do in the working environment,  for example, flight and cabin crew wanted to see more being done to tackle inflight waste,  while our ground staff wanted to see us take more proactive steps in offices and airports.  This is a positive sign, as we are seeing our staff more willing to be involved in reducing our  use of resources and increasing recycling and re-using where we can. This is encouraging  as many of our resource and waste management initiatives can only be achieved with the  support of our staff, both inflight and on the ground. In recent years, we have received considerable attention on our use of plastics inflight –   this was consistent amongst our different stakeholders – from passengers, staff and     environmental organisations. We have provided a detailed section in our factsheet\\u2009 on our plastic use. Our strategy to resource use and waste management is as follows:  1  \\x0cUpdates for 2015  Updates for 2015 In the past few years, we have initiated a number of resource use and waste management  initiatives with a full list detailed in the factsheet\\u2009 We are constantly examining options whereby we can reduce resource use and waste,   or use materials from more sustainable sources. Below are a number of initiatives which  progressed in 2015: •  We began to retire our fleet of 11 Airbus A340s. Under Airbus’ PAMELA initiative  (Process for Advanced Management of End-of-Life Aircraft), the aircraft were  systematically recycled where up to 90% of their components can be reused,  recovered, or recycled. Four aircraft were retired and recycled in 2015. The remaining  seven A340s will be retired by the end of 2017.  .  •  Trials for donating surplus food and beverages from inbound flights became a regular  occurrence. 116 tonnes of food were donated in 2015 to a food bank in Hong Kong. •  Paper saving initiatives involving process improvements and making better use of  •  Maps of Hong Kong International Airport distributed with our boarding passes to   technology resulted in savings of over 220,000 sheets at Cathay Pacific.  passengers were switched to FSC paper.  Recycling We continued with recycling initiatives inflight as well as in the offices, covering  aluminium cans, plastic bottles, cups, and glass bottles. Recycling from inbound Cathay Pacific flights in 2015 consisted of: •  Aluminium cans: 21,255 kg\\u2009 •  Plastic bottles: 20,496 kg\\u2009 •  Plastic cups: 14,975 kg\\u2009 •  Glass bottles: 488,096 kg\\u2009  2  Waste ManagementCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cUpdates for 2015  Inflight Waste Recycling (Kg)  Cathay Pacific commenced inflight glass recycling on 1 September 2011.  Aircraft With 11 A340-300s due to be retired by 2017, we began working with a company  specialising in end-of-life solutions to recycle these aircraft. Four of our A340s, each  weighing 125 tonnes, were retired and transferred to a workshop in France to be actively  recycled. Under Airbus’ PAMELA initiative (Process for Advanced Management of  End-of-Life Aircraft), the aircraft were systematically recycled where up to 90% of their  components can be reused, recovered, or recycled. Four aircraft were retired and recycled  in 2015. The remaining seven A340s will be retired by the end of 2017.

We recognise that food  waste is unavoidably created every day through our operations. We have implemented   a number of measures to reduce food waste where we can, such as reusing food offcuts,  recycling used cooking oil, donating surplus meat and vegetables from Cathay City to  the food rescue programme Food Angel, and better flight meal planning. Launched in the last quarter of 2014, trials for donating unopened juices, cereals, and  pre-packaged food from inbound flights became a regular occurrence. Cathay Pacific  Volunteers were mobilised to support this initiative jointly organised by Cathay Pacific  Catering Services Limited and Feeding Hong Kong, a local food bank. In 2015, 60 welfare  centres received 116,000 kg of food and beverages.  “Inevitably we upload more food and  beverages onboard than needed, to ensure  our passengers get sufficient choice. It’s  great for me to be able to help distribute  salvaged items to the needy. When I am  serving inflight, I will try to tidy up these items  in a way that makes it easier for volunteers   to sort them afterwards.” Jessie Chow Flight Attendant and Cathay Pacific Volunteer  Paper Through simplifying current processes and making better use of technology for handling  baggage claims and dispatching aircraft component repair orders, paper savings of over  220,000 sheets were achieved in 2015. This was a joint project between the Baggage  Services team at Hong Kong International Airport, the Business Improvement & LEAN  team at the Engineering Department, and HAECO, our aircraft engineering and  maintenance service provider.  4  Waste ManagementCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cWhat Our Stakeholders Think  What Our Stakeholders Think With the shortage of landfill space in Hong Kong, waste is a locally critical issue. It is also  a very tangible aspect of our operations to our customers and staff. This is a common  thread that has been highlighted in our stakeholder groups. There are positive perceptions  about Cathay Pacific’s performance in this area overall, but we are expected to continue  to reduce waste onboard, such as tackling the use of plastic packaging; paper use in our  offices; and communicating on our reuse and recycling practices, especially engaging  with our passengers, cabin crew and cleaning agents. Some stakeholders have also made  a link between reducing inflight waste, use of materials, resources and fuel use, in terms  of weight reduction.  5  Waste ManagementCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cOur Waste Management Commitments  Our Waste Management Commitments CX Commitments\\u2002 In 2012, we launched our commitments under our Sustainable Development Strategy.

We envision a sustainable supply chain within the  Cathay Pacific Group, and working with our suppliers is key to delivering products  and services to our customers sustainably. We work with our suppliers on a supply chain sustainability compliance process as part  of our risk management process. Many of our suppliers are companies that also report  publicly on their sustainability performance and hold similar values towards corporate  responsibility as ourselves.  1  \\x0cSustainable Sourcing Matters  In order to deliver products and services that are sustainably sourced, we need to work  with our suppliers. Developing a sustainable supply chain is a challenge due to the large  amount of items we purchase, each with varying specifications. In some cases, we may  not have leverage on all our suppliers and have limited influence on the sustainability  attributes of these materials. Moreover, our specifications need to meet very strict safety  standards, particularly if we are taking these items onboard. We are determined to find  solutions to these challenges: •  We participate in best practice sharing sessions locally and internationally: Since  2007 Cathay Pacific has been a member of the Swire Sustainable Purchasing Working  Group, which looks at synergies within the Swire Group in embedding sustainable  purchasing practices in the Swire Pacific companies. We were a founding member   of the Hong Kong Green Purchasing Charter in 2008. In 2013, we were also one   of the founding participants of the inaugural Sustainable Lifestyles Working Group  launched by non-profit sustainability organisation Business for Social Responsibility  and sustainability communications firm Futerra. In 2015, the oneworld Procurement  Best Practises Working Group – CSR was established to understand how each  member airline currently manages sustainability risk in their supply chains and   share best practises.  •  We trial and use alternative materials and implement these across the Cathay Pacific  Group: We often assess the performance of alternative materials. Once it passes   the trial phase, we implement the material across the whole Group. For example, when  we decided to switch all office paper to sustainably- sourced material, we assessed  different options from recycled paper to paper made from FSC sources. Since our  initial purchase of sustainable office paper in 2008, currently the majority of office  paper, marketing collaterals in Hong Kong, training materials, inflight magazines and  team newsletters have switched to FSC or recycled paper.  2  Sustainable SourcingCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cSustainable Sourcing Matters  Sustainable Purchasing Our purchasing practices are of the highest professional and ethical standards. Most of  the purchasing requirements for both Cathay Pacific and Dragonair are managed by the  Procurement & Aircraft Trading Department. We require the procurement of all goods   to be undertaken with full compliance to the applicable laws, tax regime and regulations  that govern the specific transaction with full cognisance taken of our Anti-Bribery,  Anti-Trust and Data Protection policies. We aim to encourage our suppliers to improve on their sustainability practices through  capacity building and sharing knowledge on best practices as part of our approach   to sustainable procurement. Our purchasing teams understand the need to consider  sustainable purchasing and responsible supply chain practices in buying decisions.   We require our suppliers to provide clear, accurate and appropriate reporting of their  progress in achieving our Supply Chain Sustainability Code of Conduct objectives. Supply Chain Sustainability Code of Conduct Since the launch of our Supply Chain Sustainability Code of Conduct in 2007, suppliers  to Cathay Pacific must provide clear, accurate and appropriate reporting of their  progress toward achieving our objectives contained in this Code. These include: •  Legal and regulatory compliance •  Environmental management •  No use of forced and child labour •  Appropriate compensation and working hours •  Health and safety in the workplace •  No discrimination against employees •  Upholding human rights in the workplace •  Having high ethical standards •  Extending social responsibility to their subcontractors and service providers •  Maintaining documentation and permitting our inspection In developing and revising the Code, we took account of the International Labour  Organization’s core conventions and other applicable and recognised labour standards,  referred and benchmarked against the United Nations Global Compact.  3  Sustainable SourcingCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cSustainable Sourcing Matters  Revised Code of Conduct to include ethics  Identified the need for a more coordinated approach to  sustainability in our supply chain  Developed and launched our Code of Conduct First questionnaires sent to Hong Kong-based suppliers  Launched online tool for suppliers to complete questionnaire  regarding their compliance with our Code. New suppliers are  contractually committed to meeting our Code of Conduct  First publication of the Supply Chain Sustainability Newsletter  distributed to local and outport suppliers Outport-based suppliers asked to complete questionnaire for  the first time  Timeline for Working with Our Supply Chain 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Sustainable Sourcing It is our goal to ensure that we establish sustainable sourcing practices throughout our  operations. We started embedding these practices by understanding the consumption  of resources across different business units. To understand how we can achieve our  sourcing goals, commonly procured items were identified and areas where there is  potential for reduced usage were assessed. More information is provided in the Waste  Management section of our report.  The Corporate Social Responsibility Code of Conduct renamed  as the Supply Chain Sustainability Code of Conduct  Development of a framework for supply chain compliance  checking  Project Horizon commenced to modernise and improve  procurement processes and activities  4  Sustainable SourcingCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cUpdates for 2015  Updates for 2015 Inflight Cocktail Snacks Cathay Pacific switched to a new supply of roasted peanuts using sustainably produced  palm oil following the inclusion of this new requirement in our tender. Developed by the  Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil, Certified Sustainable Palm Oil must meet a set   of environmental and social criteria to help minimise any negative impacts such as  deforestation whilst protecting the rights of indigenous people. Inflight Carpets Our Economy Class cabin, which was first introduced in 2012, features carpets produced  from regenerated nylon waste materials such as discarded fishing nets, fabric, and carpets.  These have been installed across Cathay Pacific and Dragonair wide-bodied passenger  aircraft such as the Airbus A330 and Boeing 777. The use of regenerated material helps to eliminate waste and reduce the energy needed  for the primary production of nylon. More importantly, the removal of marine debris such  as discarded fishing nets can reduce the threat posed to marine animals. oneworld / Sedex Membership As a founding member of oneworld, the oneworld Procurement Best Practises Working  Group – CSR was established in 2015 to understand how each member airline currently  manages sustainability risk in their supply chains and share best practises.  5  Sustainable SourcingCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cWhat Our Stakeholders Think  What Our Stakeholders Think The sustainability of supply chains has gained in importance in the last few years, as  businesses look beyond the impacts and performance of their immediate operations.  Stakeholders are increasingly looking for us to incorporate green purchasing guidelines  into environmental and sustainability policies, and show a more integrated view of  environmental and sustainable development management across the business value  chain.

We recognise that we have an impact on the destinations to which we fly, and hence  we continue to develop and incorporate biodiversity elements into our sustainable  development strategy. Conservation has long been a topic of concern for Cathay Pacific. For many years, we have  been sponsoring habitat-protection programmes within Asia, and working with NGOs from  across the region. For instance, working with Friends of the Earth, we provided funding  that resulted in the planting of 10,000 tree seedlings around Hong Kong. We also raised  nearly HK$8 million from passengers to support conservation initiatives in mainland China  through The Nature Conservancy. Partnering with the Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Gardens  in Hong Kong, we helped reintroduce 609 endangered pig-nosed turtles to Indonesia   by donating cargo space and air tickets to the organisation. Since at least 2009, Cathay  Pacific has been engaging with shark conservation specialists and organisations to  understand the issue and explore our role as a responsible business. We are one of the  first airlines in the world to raise the awareness of the unsustainability of the global shark  trade. We will continue to direct investments in biodiversity conservation as a way to give  back to the community.  1  \\x0cBiodiversity Matters  It is important that our inflight meals are sustainably sourced as well. On average,   Cathay Pacific and Dragonair serve 110,155 inflight meals everyday to our passengers.  Therefore, by adhering to international sustainability standards, we can have a substantial  positive impact on the diversity of a wide variety of ecosystems. We have already  adopted a Sustainable Food Policy that does not allow the serving of a number of  unsustainably produced food items, including shark fin soup, both inflight and at  company-paid functions. Since 2011, we have been serving fish from sustainable  sources, such as those that are Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certified, in Economy  Class on all our flights departing from Europe. We follow a similar policy for fish served   in Economy Class on flights from Australian and North American ports.

Finally,  there is a way to stop it |  Dynamite Fishing  Updates for 2015 Cathay Pacific delivered an endangered Sumatran rhino, Harapan, safely from the   United States to his indigenous home in Indonesia. With fewer than 100 of these animals  remaining in the wild in the world, Harapan was transported back to the Sumatran Rhino  Sanctuary for breeding and conservation purposes. Harapan was accompanied by a  veteran animal keeper during the 16,000-kilometre journey. In preparation, the 816-kilogram  rhino underwent medical checks and was trained to walk into and voluntarily remain in his  crate. In addition, we assisted the Toronto Zoo by shipping boots and filtration equipment  to rhino conservation rangers in Indonesia free of charge. In addition to adhering to the Convention on International Trade and Endangered Species  (CITES) requirements on the transport of endangered animals and plants listed under  Appendices 1 and 2 of the Convention, we placed an embargo on the transportation of   a) hunting trophies; and b) racing greyhounds (exporting from Australia to any destination  and importing to Hong Kong from any place of origins). In early 2015, we started supporting the work of Stop Fish Bombing!, a non-profit  organisation based in Hong Kong that incorporates a Silicon Valley-based technology  company and a TV production company in Malaysia. Stop Fish Bombing! is working with  governments, local authorities, NGOs, and the private sector to develop underwater  bomb detection technology against fish bombing and raise public aware on this issue. In mid-2015, an acceptance procedure for shark and shark-related products was   issued to all Cathay Pacific and Dragonair ports. Requests for the shipment of shark   or shark products were required to be assessed by an external expert panel of two   highly respected international shark conservation agencies, in accordance with the  sustainability of the species, before they could be considered for carriage.  3  BiodiversityCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cWhat Our Stakeholders Think  What Our Stakeholders Think Today, companies are increasingly expected to understand their biodiversity impact   and to determine ways to protect and enhance biodiversity as part of their business  operations. This means that in addition to supporting habitat protection and animal  welfare initiatives undertaken by third parties, we are expected to take action to reduce  the impact from our daily operations. Our efforts regarding shark and shark products  have particularly been viewed as a strong positive move by stakeholders.  4  BiodiversityCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cOur Biodiversity Commitments  Our Biodiversity Commitments CX Commitments\\u2002 Based on the input of our stakeholders and our strong support for reducing the negative impact of our daily  operations on biodiversity, we are committed to the following actions:  20/20  Commitments Develop and  implement   a sustainable  cargo policy   Progress  Why this commitment?

Industrial relations continue to be an important issue, however we are  actively working with the various groups to continue to enhance communication and  consultation to ensure views are heard and acted upon appropriately. As a major employer supporting Hong Kong, it has been our long-standing practice to  support local recruitment. If the required skills are available locally, we will give priority   to the local labour market before searching internationally. Vacancies are first opened  internally to the company, then to the local community, and only then, overseas. Most of  our overseas hiring relates to skills or experience that is not readily available in the local  labour market, such as engineering and flight crew – which is why we have extensive local  engineering and flight crew training to help build these skills in Hong Kong.

Below are some  highlights from 2015: All Staff New online platforms for social media and crowdsourcing ideas were launched for  Cathay Pacific and Dragonair staff. Yammer, an enterprise social media platform, was launched to enable staff and teams   to communicate and collaborate in a completely different way. Accessible through PCs  and mobile apps, staff can join a wide variety of work and leisure groups to engage and  interact with people in their departments or those who share the same interests. Overall  10,000 staff has since joined the company Yammer network. A sustainability group was  set up, and staff have been actively contributing posts on waste reduction, energy  efficiency improvement and environmental developments in the industry. Spark, an online platform for crowdsourcing ideas, was launched corporate-wide in 2015  with a sustainability themed challenge. Staff were asked to submit and vote on ideas   on how we might become a more sustainable airline group. Over a three-week period,   92 ideas were submitted under the three categories of customers, operations, and  suppliers. The top two winning ideas involved making our amenity kits more sustainable  and making our office greener. These were considered by the Innovation Council and  respective departments.  3  Our PeopleCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cUpdates for 2015  Flight Crew Employee relations teams across Cathay and Dragonair support pilots on matters relating  to their employment and wellbeing, benefits, rostering, sickness and injury; and on those  that are technical and operational. Our pilots who are based in Hong Kong and across  Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand are represented by various associations,  and industrial matters remain ongoing. Dragonair continued engaging with the Dragonair Pilots Association. Communications  with crew continued with twice-monthly fleet forums, and ‘town hall’ meetings with   the management. There were also regular bulletins from the Director Operations and  other managers.  Cabin Crew Cathay Pacific In 2015, we continued to produce bi-weekly Cabin Crew Newsletter and monthly Cabin  Safety Newsletter to ensure our Cabin Crew are well informed. Discussions between Cathay Pacific management and the Flight Attendants’ Union took  place at end of 2015 and an agreement was reached by both parties. The dialogue on  mutually important matters continues. As part of continuous improvement effort, we will be conducting another CONNECT crew  engagement survey in 2016.  4  Our PeopleCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cUpdates for 2015  Dragonair Thirteen crew forums were held in Hong Kong and Shanghai to facilitate enhanced  communication and engagement. More than 250 cabin crew across different ranks and  ethnic groups, including those from the Japanese and Korean communities, attended  these events. In celebration of Dragonair’s 30th Anniversary and the 10th anniversary of the Shanghai  cabin crew base, the management team attended the celebratory event in Shanghai  involving over 70 cabin crew as helpers and performers. DragonTV was expanded from quarterly releases to monthly episodes, which are hosted  by General Manager Inflight Services. An additional four special editions covered events  including Dragonair being named as Skytrax ‘World’s Best Regional Airline’ and Dragonair’s  30th Anniversary. We continued with monthly publications of the Cabin Crew Newsletter. Recruitment A total of 2,038 flight crew, cabin crew and ground staff in both Cathay Pacific and  Dragonair were recruited in 2015 to support the expansion of our business. An additional  1,355 staff joined our other subsidiaries in Hong Kong. In the second year of our IT Graduate Trainee programme, 10 graduates were chosen  from more than 530 applicants. The IT Trainees are undergoing a two-year rotation  through a range of core IT disciplines, including business intelligence, digital retail,  customer relationship management, supply chain management and infrastructure. Training and Development In 2015, induction training was conducted with 781 new Cathay Pacific cabin crew  recruits, and 446 cabin crew went through promotion training.  Throughout the year,   over 9,000 crew attended the annual refresher training class on Disability Awareness   and Occupational Health and Safety for all cabin crew.  We also provided a series of  workshops for voluntary personal development. To ensure our crew is well prepared for the new Airbus A350, a new door trainer was  purchased and installed for safety and emergency training. In 2015, 21 new mentors participated in the Dragonair Mentor Development Workshop  with a vision of becoming an effective mentor for their cabin crew peers. In addition to  mindset and skills-in-career mentoring, the workshop also provided techniques in  exploring life interest, overcoming stress and communicating with different generations.  More than 120 mentees benefited from the program this year.  5  Our PeopleCathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cStakeholder Views  Want to find out   more?

The assurance scope and statement is provided below. Selected  subject matter that has been verified are marked with a “ ”.  2  About this Report    PricewaterhouseCoopers Ltd., 22/F Prince’s Building, Central, Hong Kong T: +852 2289 8888, F: +852 2810 9888, www.pwc.com   Independent practitioner’s limited assurance report  To the board of directors of Cathay Pacific Airways Limited    We have undertaken a limited assurance engagement in respect of the selected sustainability information of Cathay Pacific Airways Limited (the “Company”) listed below and identified with a ∆  in the Company’s sustainability report for the year ended 31 December 2015 (“the Sustainable Development Report 2015”) (the “Identified Sustainability Information”).   Identified Sustainability Information  The Identified Sustainability Information for the year ended 31 December 2015 is summarised below:  1) Greenhouse Gases (“GHG”) emissions data  Aircraft operations \\uf0b7 Carbon Dioxide (CO2)  Unit of measure Tonnes Other operations \\uf0b7 CO2 emission from electricity \\uf0b7 CO2 emission from ground vehicles \\uf0b7 CO2 emission from town gas Unit of measure Tonnes Tonnes Tonnes  2) Selected quantitative data \\uf0b7 The mathematical accuracy of the grammes/ATK and grammes/RTK computation for 2015 (to be used by the Company to determine fuel efficiency).  \\uf0b7 Outcome of the Fly greener programme in 2015: (i)  the total number of offsets for staff travelling on business, and  (ii) the total number of offsets bought by passengers.  \\uf0b7 Weight  of recycled material from inbound Hong Kong Cathay Pacific flights:  - Aluminium cans (kg) - Plastic cups (kg) - Plastic bottles (kg) - Glass bottles (kg)  \\uf0b7 Amount of recycled material from Cathay Pacific City and Dragonair House:  - Paper and cardboard (kg) - Aluminium cans (kg) - Plastic (kg) - Printer cartridges (pieces) (Note: Cathay Pacific City and Dragonair House combined figure)  \\uf0b7 Data regarding the English on Air (“EOA”) programme during the 2014/2015 academic year: “A total of 168 students from five schools in Tung Chung participated in the English on Air programme during the 2014/2015 academic year.”  \\uf0b7 Data regarding the food donation programme during 2015: “60 welfare centres received 116,000 kg of food and beverages.”  Our assurance was with respect to the year ended 31 December 2015 information only and we have not performed any procedures with respect to earlier periods or any other elements included in the Sustainable Development Report 2015 and, therefore, do not express any conclusion thereon. Cathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cIndependent Assurance Statement  3  About this Report  2   Criteria  The criteria used by the Company to prepare the Identified Sustainability Information is set out under the heading “Reporting Methodology” in the section “About this Report” of the Sustainable Development Report 2015 at www.cathaypacific.com/sdreport (the “Criteria”).  The Company’s Responsibility for the Identified Sustainability Information  The Company is responsible for the preparation of the Identified Sustainability Information in accordance with the Criteria. This responsibility includes the design, implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation of Identified Sustainability Information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.  Inherent limitations  The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-financial information allows for different, but acceptable, measures and measurement techniques and can affect comparability between entities. In addition, GHG quantification is subject to inherent uncertainty because of incomplete scientific knowledge used to determine emissions factors and the values needed to combine emissions of different gases.  Our Independence and Quality Control  We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour.   Our firm applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.  Our Responsibility  Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the Identified Sustainability Information based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained. We conducted our limited assurance engagement in accordance with (i) International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised), Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, for selected quantitative data, and, (ii) International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3410, Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements, for GHG emissions data, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. These standards require that we plan and perform this engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the Identified Sustainability Information is free from material misstatement.  A limited assurance engagement involves assessing the suitability in the circumstances of the Company’s use of the Criteria as the basis for the preparation of the Identified Sustainability Information, assessing the risks of material misstatement of the Identified Sustainability Information whether due to fraud or error, responding to the assessed risks as necessary in the circumstances, and evaluating the overall presentation of the Identified Sustainability Information. A limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in relation to both the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal control, and the procedures performed in response to the assessed risks.  The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment and included inquiries, observation of processes performed, inspection of documents, analytical procedures, evaluating the Cathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cIndependent Assurance Statement  4  About this Report  3  appropriateness of quantification methods and reporting policies, and agreeing or reconciling with underlying records.  Given the circumstances of the engagement, in performing the procedures listed above we:  \\uf0b7 Made inquiries of relevant management of the Company; \\uf0b7 Understood the process for collecting and reporting the Identified Sustainability Information; \\uf0b7 Undertook analytical procedures over the Identified Sustainability Information; \\uf0b7 Performed limited substantive testing on a selective basis of the Identified Sustainability Information; and \\uf0b7 Considered the disclosure and presentation of the Identified Sustainability Information.  The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had we performed a reasonable assurance engagement. Accordingly, we do not express a reasonable assurance opinion about whether the Company’s Identified Sustainability Information has been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria.  Limited Assurance Conclusion  Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Company’s Identified Sustainability Information for the year ended December 31, 2015 is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria.  Our report has been prepared for and only for the board of directors of the Company and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility towards or accept liability to any other person for the content of this report.

How We Report The content of this report has been defined by a process of: •  •  •  •  benchmarking against other airlines and international companies. Measuring Our Performance We continue to report on progress against our 20 commitments under the Sustainable  Development Strategy. Reporting Tools To avoid ambiguity, definitions of each parameter are communicated across the Cathay  Pacific Group to ensure the quality and consistency of reporting. The majority of data is  collated via Swire’s new sustainability management system, Resource Advisor, a database  for our operations in Hong Kong covering Cathay Pacific, Dragonair, 100% owned and 60%  owned Hong Kong-based subsidiaries. Cathay Holidays Limited and outports reported  separately via questionnaires. The new system facilitates collecting, consolidating,  analysing and reporting our environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance  across the Group’s diverse businesses located in different jurisdictions.  6  About this Report Cathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cReporting Methodology  GHG Emissions Accounting and Reporting Policies The inventory of our greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions is reported in accordance with  the World Resources Institute and World Business Council on Sustainable Development’s  Greenhouse Gas Protocol (2004, Revised Editions). Organisational Boundaries The Cathay Pacific Group reported the greenhouse gas emissions of each of its  subsidiaries below in proportion to their ownership percentage. The organisational  boundaries for the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions include Cathay Pacific  Airways and the following 100% and 60% owned Hong Kong-based companies   (the “subsidiaries”): •  Hong Kong Dragon Airlines Limited (KA) •  Cathay Holidays Limited (CHL) •  Cathay Pacific Catering Services (H.K.) Limited (CPCS) •  Cathay Pacific Services Limited (CPSL) •  Hong Kong Airport Services Limited (HAS) •  Vogue Laundry Service Limited (VLS) •  AHK Air Hong Kong Limited (AHK) (60% owned) Other principal subsidiaries and associates, as outlined on pages 98 to 99 of the Cathay  Pacific Group 2015 Annual Report that are not included within the scope of this report,  will be considered for inclusion in the future. Operational Boundaries The operational boundaries for the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions are as follows: •  Scope 1 – Direct GHG emission, including global CO2 emissions from flights, ground  •  Scope 2 – Electricity and Towngas (production) indirect GHG emissions The reporting period of the GHG data is the twelve-month period of 1 January to   31 December 2015. The year 2009 has been used as the base year for comparing the  emissions profile of our flights in line with our 20/20 commitments. However, we continue  to provide information from 1998 to ensure consistency with our previous reporting.  Please note there have been changes in organisation and operational boundaries over  the years which may impact comparability.  vehicles and Towngas combustion  7  About this Report Cathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cReporting Methodology  Scope 1 Emissions Scope 1 emissions include fuel and Towngas usage from ground-based activities in  Hong Kong covering Cathay Pacific and the subsidiaries. In Hong Kong, the CO2 emission  factors used follow the guidelines published by the Environmental Protection Department  (EPD) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HK SAR) Government in February  20101. For CO2 emission factors for outport data, references have been made to the  International Energy Agency (2010)2. In respect of our GHG emissions from aircraft fuel consumption, our scope includes   all flight activities, including testing, training flights, dry lease and wet lease. As fuel  density varies according to a number of factors, we use the Joint Inspection Group’s3  recommended specific gravity of 0.80 kg/L to calculate the weight of fuel. We use the  IPCC’s emission factor of 3.154 to determine CO2 emissions from the combustion of  aircraft fuel. Scope 2 Emissions Our scope includes electricity consumption and Towngas production for our operations  in Hong Kong covering Cathay Pacific and the subsidiaries. Emission factors used in our  scope follow the guidelines published by the EPD of the HK SAR Government in February  2010, the International Energy Agency (2010), and the relevant utilities. For GHGs, other than CO2, others including CH4, N2O, PFCs and SFs are either not  applicable or not material to the overall GHG reporting. Towngas is also used in the Cathay Pacific canteen. As this is operated by a third party,  consistent with the previous year, it is specifically excluded. Methodologies Used to Calculate or Measure Emissions Refer to Endnote References.  8  About this Report Cathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cReporting Methodology  Other Indicators Environmental Indicators The scope of this year’s reported resource usage includes operations in Hong Kong  covering Cathay Pacific, the 100% and 60% owned subsidiaries, energy consumption  and greenhouse gas data from four outports (Auckland, Taipei, Manila and San Francisco)  and non-GHG data from five outports (Frankfurt, Paris, Karachi, Kuala Lumpur and Sydney)  which were able to provide auditable numbers. We will continue to work on increasing the  scope to cover all major outports in future reports. Social Indicators Operations in Hong Kong covering Cathay Pacific and the 100% and 60% owned  subsidiaries are included on the Social Indicators table. GRI Content Index The GRI Content Index is prepared with reference to the GRI G4 Guidelines ‘in accordance  option’ Core. The GRI Content Index does not reflect actual implementation of Cathay  Pacific’s sustainable development initiatives nor the value or quality of the report and   its content. Other Matters FLY greener Offsets FLY greener offsets are calculated as the tonnes of CO2 purchased by all passengers  (including staff), using either cash or Air Miles as a method of payment. One tonne   of CO2 had a cash price of HK$25.51 in 2015. The average Air Miles price was 626   Air Miles per tonne of CO2 during the year ended 31 December 2015. The total tonnage  was computed based on the amount paid during the year. Cash received during the year  related to flights taken in 2015. Fuel Efficiency Fuel efficiency is calculated as fuel usage per available tonne kilometre (ATK). ATK is  defined in the Cathay Pacific Airways Limited Annual Report 2015 as overall capacity,  measured in tonnes available for the carriage of passengers, excess baggage, cargo   and mail on each sector multiplied by the sector distance. RTK is defined as traffic volume, measured in load tonnes from the carriage of passengers,  excess baggage, cargo and mail on each sector multiplied by the sector distance. The fuel consumption figure shown on the Environmental Indicators Table only includes  Cathay Pacific and Dragonair for comparability with last year’s report. ATK of 30,048 million and RTK of 22,220 million used in this calculation are taken from  the Cathay Pacific Airways Limited Annual Report 2015.  9  About this Report Cathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cReporting Methodology  Recycled Materials In 2015, materials recycled from inbound flights to Hong Kong include plastic cups;  plastic bottles; aluminium cans; and glass bottles. Materials recycled by the Cathay  Pacific Airways and 100% owned subsidiaries include paper and cardboard, plastics,  aluminium cans, waste lubrication oil, glass bottles and printer cartridges from Cathay  Pacific City; and paper and cardboard, aluminium cans, plastic and printer cartridges  from Dragonair House. The amount of recycled materials refers to those recorded in  either recycling vendor invoices or internal tracking records. Food Donation In 2015, unconsumed food items such as unopened juices, cereals, and pre-packaged  food from Cathay Pacific inbound flights to Hong Kong were collected for donation to   a local food bank. The amount of donated food and beverages refers to those in the  tracking records of the local food bank. English on Air English on Air is an educational programme which involves English-speaking Cathay  Pacific staff volunteers from a wide variety of nationalities and backgrounds who  encourage local students to speak English. Participating students are invited to Cathay  Pacific City to meet and chat with volunteers during English-speaking sessions. London Benchmarking Group The London Benchmarking Group model is used by companies to assess and report on  the value and achievements of their corporate community investment. It takes the form  of a matrix that helps to summarise, and quantify, the achievements of a community  activity. It breaks down the elements of the activity, detailing the different inputs, then  going on to establish the outputs and, eventually, the impacts that these have achieved. We evaluated the effectiveness of our English on Air activities run during the academic  year 2014/2015 with reference to the London Benchmarking Group model. We developed  questionnaires covering the areas indicated below and conducted surveys with the  participating students and teachers in order to develop a scorecard of these areas. •  Leverage company resources •  English opportunities •  Increase confidence •  School partnership •  Awareness of aviation and Cathay Pacific Airways  10  About this Report Cathay Pacific Sustainable Development Report 2015\\x0cReporting Methodology  Materiality Matrix The materiality matrix plots our corporate social responsibilities issues in two dimensions:  the importance of the issue to our stakeholders and the impact of the issue to Cathay  Pacific.  In order to develop this, we have been engaging with a third party consultant  since 2006 to perform focus groups and interviews with selected groups of stakeholders,  chosen by Cathay Pacific and the third party consultant. Previously, the selected stakeholder  groups provided comments and ratings on different areas, including emerging issues  facing the airline industry, perceptions on the current corporate social responsibility  (CSR) performance of Cathay Pacific and Dragonair and the expected response from  Cathay Pacific, our reporting priorities, the stakeholder engagement approach taken by  Cathay Pacific, and their views on Cathay Pacific’s Sustainable Development Strategy. With these comments and rating, we summarised stakeholders’ concerns into material  issues. For each of the material issues, we evaluated the impact of the issue to Cathay  Pacific and produced a materiality matrix, which helps to structure our Sustainable  Development Report for the year ended 31 December 2015. Following the end of our five-year stakeholder engagement strategy in 2012, we carried  out a comprehensive survey in 2013/2014. The objectives of this exercise were to create  a baseline and a set of metrics on the following: Measure stakeholder familiarity with Cathay Pacific initiatives and performance •  Assess stakeholder perceptions •  •  Determine stakeholder expectations •  Evaluate Cathay Pacific strength and weakness The other objective is to develop actions based on these research findings.
