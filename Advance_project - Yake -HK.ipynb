      "extreme cases and polar types in which the process of interest may be clearly recognized.\n",
      "Finally, an inductive and open-ended research approach identifies themes from the data\n",
      "through several iterations with the extant literature.\n",
      "According to this model, the sociological phenomena cannot simply be observed but also\n",
      "must be interpreted by the researchers (Crotty, 1998). Thismeans that there is no one absolute\n",

       "'Fostering digital transformation of SMEs: a four levels approach Antonello Garzoni and Ivano De Turi Department of Economics and Management, Universita LUM Jean Monnet, Casamassima, Italy, and Giustina Secundo and Pasquale Del Vecchio Department of Innovation Engineering, University of Salento, Lecce, Italy Abstract Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to analyse how digital technologies trigger changes in the business process of manufacturing small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the Apulia Region (South Italy). As SMEs play an essential role in the process value creation of industries and countries, the article examines the enablers of Industry 4.0 in a regional contexts characterized by delay in research and development and innovation performances where the companies’ competitiveness is based on limited knowledge and technological assets. Design/methodology/approach – The case study of Smart District 4.0, an ongoing project aimed to promote the digitalization of SMEs operating in the Agri–Food, Clothing–Footwear and Mechanics– Mechatronics in the Apulia Region (South Italy) is analysed. The project has been financed by the Italian Ministry of Economic Development with the final aim to sustain the digital transformation of SMEs in South Italy. Findings – The results introduce a four levels approach of engagement of SMEs in the adoption of digital technologies, namely, digital awareness, digital enquirement, digital collaboration and digital transformation. Furthermore, for each level of engagement the study describes and discusses some relevant variables that could be used by managers and entrepreneurs to assess the level of readiness for utilization of digital technologies and how to digitalize some processes. Practical implications – Practical implications regard the definition of a roadmap useful to assess and manage the level of digital transformation of SMEs. Limitations of the study regarding the temporal dimension of the evidences associated to the Smart District 4.0 as well as to the regional context was analysed. Originality/value – Originality resides in the definition of a roadmap for the digital transformation of SMEs in a region where the profile of companies’ digital maturity is still low. Keywords SMEs, Digital technologies, Value chain, Digital awareness, Digital transformation, Digital collaboration, Industry 4.0 Paper type Research paper 1. Introduction New digital paradigms include a vast array of enabling digital technologies (DT), such as the Internet of things (IoTs), additive manufacturing, big data, artificial intelligence, cloud computing and augmented and virtual reality (Rindfleisch et al., 2017; Nambisan, 2017). The large diffusion of these technologies is a pervasive process that is interesting all the industries by causing a radical reconfiguration of firms’ organizational and strategic models (Urbinati et al., 2018); and it is the feature at the basis of emergence of the Industry 4.0 (Frank et al., 2019). Industry 4.0 is a new industrial scenario characterized by the convergence of the DT Impact of digital transformation of SMEs The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers and the guest editor Prof Rosa Lombardi for their support and insights. Furthermore, they are very grateful to the Research Team of the LUM Enterprise: Director Antonio Bianchin, Project Manager Nicola Magaletti and the research scientists Margaret Antonicelli andMichele Leone, for sharing all the relevant information about the project Smart District 4.0. The current issue and full text archive of this journal is available on Emerald Insight at: https://www.emerald.com/insight/0025-1747.htm Received 16 July 2019 Revised 2 October 2019 7 November 2019 Accepted 9 December 2019 Management Decision © Emerald Publishing Limited 0025-1747 DOI 10.1108/MD-07-2019-0939 recalled above into intelligent socio-economic systems in the value creation process of industries (Muller et al., 2018). The pervasiveness and the knowledge intensive nature of these technologies disclose a technology-push innovation approach and open new scenarios for the competitiveness of both innovative and traditional industries. Despite Industry 4.0 results to be more compliant with the organizational and strategic settings of big corporations, due to the large investments required as well as to the human competencies available, it requires flexibility, decentralization, customer proximity and lean decision-making processes that are affordable more typically by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) (Moeuf et al., 2017). Digital transformation (DT) in SMEs is a topic of great actuality and interest in the agenda of scholars and practitioners (Cha et al., 2015: Li et al., 2018). The increasing use of advanced DT is transforming innovation and production processes (Alc\\x01acer et al., 2016; Urbinati et al., 2018). Defined as the result of the introduction of “transformational information technology” (Lucas et al., 2013, p. 372), Industry 4.0 involves fundamental changes in the configuration and execution of business processes (Venkatraman, 1994), operational routines (Chen et al., 2014) and organizational capabilities (Tan et al., 2015). However, the transition towards an Industry 4.0 perspective could be more complex in the context of SMEs where IoT, big data analytics, artificial intelligence and blockchains, generally have implications to design, implement and achieve the full digitalization of their strategic and organizational models. This because SMEs are characterized by limited resources and present gaps in terms of cognitive and organizational assets so necessary to lead the introduction of DT (Li et al., 2018). Furthermore, “the concept of smart technology itself has however been scarcely defined and conceptualized beyond technological fields and perspectives” (Lee, 2012; as cited in Neuhofer et al., 2015, p. 243) and since “there is limited understanding of how organizations need to change to embrace these technological innovations and the business shifts they entail. Even more, the business value and strategic relevance of. . .technologies still remain largely underexplored” (Mikalef et al., 2017, np). Moving from the above research gaps, the literature highlights the need for a deepened comprehension of business andmanagerial aspects of DT, mainly in the context of SMEs where the potentiality of DT requires the adoption of models inspired to the principles of collaboration and networking. Framed in the above premises, this paper aims to contribute at the debate on DT in SMEs through the evidences of Smart District 4.0, a pivotal initiative launched in the Apulia Region (Southern Italy) aimed to sustain the process of DT of SMEs operating in the field of the Agri– Food, Clothing–Footwear and Mechanics–Mechatronics. Accordingly, the paper tries to answer the following research question: How to engage the SMEs in the adoption of DT for achieving a process of digital transformation? Adopting a qualitative approach based on an extreme case study (Eisenhardt, 1989; Yin, 1984), the paper analyses the Smart District 4.0, a joint project launched by LUM Enterprise (a spin-off of the LUM Jean Monnet University in Casamassima, Bari, Italy) and Noovle, and it aimed to design and realize processes of digitization with a specific target related to SMEs operating in the agri–food, textile, clothing, footwear, mechatronics and mechanics. For its characteristics and features, the case can be classified as an extreme case study (Eisenhardt, 1989; Yin, 1984). The results allowed to comprehend the main limitations and obstacles for the implementation of DT within the Apulian SMEs in the identified industries. The case Smart District 4.0 showed the importance of the adoption of a four levels model for the achievement of DTof SMEs.Despite technologybeing essential for such aprocess of digitization, critical success factors for this transition could be identified into the human and social capital of the SMEs. The remaining of the paper is organised as follows: Section 2 introduces the literature background around the main pillars of DT and digital transformation of SMEs. Section 3 describes the research methodology, Section 4 describes the findings and finally Section 5 discusses and concludes the paper. MD 2. Literature background 2.1 Digital technologies and Industry 4.0 DT has been defined as an iterative organizational process, comprising incremental and disruptive changes enabled by DT (Barann et al., 2019), to automatize business process (Lombardi et al., 2019), make the current logistical and administrative business that underpin day-to-day operations more efficient – thereby enabling the business to be more competitive (Lu et al., 2017). Despite its technological profile, its implementation requires the ability to adapt the business model to the new technologies and lead technological innovations in the socio-technical environment (Frank, et al., 2019;M€uller et al., 2018; Lu, 2017;Moeuf, et al., 2017; Bauer et al., 2015). Within the wide scenario of DT, in the past year the concept of Industry 4.0 has been developed from an initiative launched by the German government for safeguarding the long- term competitiveness of the manufacturing industry (Kagermann et al., 2013; Lu, 2017). Industry 4.0 is considered a new industrial scenario in which the convergence of different emerging DT strengthen by the IoTs results in cyber-physical and intelligent systems that can create value for the industrial activities (M€uller et al., 2018; Sung et al., 2018; Liao et al., 2017). Thanks to the digital platforms offered by the Internet, mature industries are now facing a transformation towards a digitalized era, where machines, devices and products can be interconnected to adapt themselves and be flexible to quickly attend to market changes (Wei et al., 2017). By integrating the physical and the DT in industrial manufacturing (Lasi et al., 2014), Industry 4.0 aims at establishing intelligent, self-regulating and interconnected industrial value creation (Reischauer, 2018; Liao et al., 2017; Yin et al., 2018). The integration and the large adoption of DT for companies’ business process comprise smart machines, storage systems and production facilities, which are able to exchange information, initiate actions andmutually control each other. Their interconnection via the Internet, also termed as the IoTs generates technological leaps in engineering, manufacturing, material flow and supply chain management (Kagermann et al., 2013). Thanks to the connectivity platform and to the DT, companies interact electronically and seamlessly, thus avoiding (or significantly reducing) manual data processing. Nambisan (2017) introduced the concept of DT as the result of three distinct but related elements: digital artifacts, digital infrastructure and digital platforms as fundamental for the digital transformation and innovation of companies. Digital artifact can be defined as a digital component, application or media content that is part of a new product (or service) and offers a specific functionality or value to the end-user (Ekbia, 2009; Kallinikos et al., 2013). Digital infrastructure is defined as digital technology tools and systems that offer communication, collaboration and/or computing capabilities (Nambisan, 2017). Infrastructure can be defined in general as the basic physical and organizational structures needed for the operation of a society or organizations (Tilson et al., 2010). As the digitalization brings basic information technologies and organizational structures, digital infrastructures are regarded as socio- technical systems, consisting of more than technology components (Ciborra et al., 2000). The more the actors’ participations themore the evolution and innovation of digital infrastructure is. Digital infrastructure as cloud computing, data analytics, online communities, social media, 3D printing, digital makerspaces, can support the business process of companies. Digital platforms are shared, common set of services and architecture that serves to host complementary offerings, including digital artifacts (Parker et al., 2016; Tiwana et al., 2010). They can be defined a software-based platform as the extensible codebase of a software- based system that provides core functionality shared by themodules that interoperate with it and the interfaces through which they interoperate (e.g. Apple’s iOS and Mozilla’s Firefox browser) (Tiwana et al., 2010). The DT as composed by digital artifact, digital infrastructure and digital platforms are at the basis of the digital transformation of companies. Challenges lie in the way of realising the full potential of the emerging DT starting from a basic Impact of digital transformation of SMEs awareness about the potential role of these technologies and from a diffused digital culture within people. 2.2 The digital transformation of SMEs: opportunities and threats SMEs provide a fruitful research sample, as those represent over 99 per cent of the companies located in the European Union (EU) and hire between 50 per cent and 70 per cent of the full time equivalent number of persons employed. With a gross value added share of over 50 per cent of the European Economy (Airaksinen et al., 2015), SMEs require research that helps them sustain their economic significance in times of unrelenting technological developments and digital transformations. In the context of SMEs, DT is concerned with the digitalization of the whole organization and business processes (Lu, 2017). Furthermore, the process of DT calls for an innovative cultural approach able to sustain the radical change of the companies’ organizational settings along the complex path towards the digital configuration in the present as well as in the future. The role of the government is fundamental that should be able to function as orchestrator and funders of initiatives according to the general recommendations coming from EU and other international institutions, like in Italy has been done through the plan “Italy: Industria 4.0”. It is in this venue that Kane et al. (2019) have recently described as in implementing a DT process companies move towards a four-stage evolutionary path associated to a growing level of changes due to the introduction of DT. These phases have been identified in: (1) the exploration of DT, as preliminary stage causing minimal changes into the organization, (2) the development of digital initiatives, as second stage characterized by an increased attention to the DT even if the company remains focussed on its business, operational and strategic model, (3) the digital maturity, as stage of deliberated adoption of DT in all the organizational actions and goals and (4) being a digital organization, as aspirational last behaviour of full digitalization involving the company’s environment and ecosystem (Kane et al., 2019). In this sense, Industry 4.0 trend is mainly based on the technology-push innovation approach, since it comes from the direct competitors inside the product firms own industry (Dosi 1982; Lasi et al., 2014). Several scholars have stressed that this technology-push innovation also implies a radical business model innovation of the manufacturing companies (M€uller et al., 2018;Wei et al., 2017). As sum ofmechanisms and approaches for value creation, value offer and value capture (M€uller et al., 2018), business models are interested in all their components by the process digitalization associated to Industry 4.0. Specifically, companies can achieve new opportunities and scenario of data-driven value creation, new perspectives for servitization for the innovation in the value offer and larger opportunities for a more effective capture of the value created based on an extensive connectivity (M€uller et al., 2018). Moreover, a high number of SMEs is active in niche markets (Knight, 2000), offering products manufactured in small series or on an individual basis. Such companies frequently require basic versions of the machinery and tools employed in the production facilities of large organizations. Several initiatives have been launched by the European Commission for supporting the engagement of SMEs in digitalization projects as well as for promoting Industry 4.0 initiatives. Some critical factors for the success have been identified into the commitment of a larger community of stakeholders and so the need of adopting an industry- based perspective instead of the single company; the cooperation with multipliers and intermediaries to better perform on target groups; the focus on specific business segments and scenarios, also through the identification of pilot project to demonstrate the benefits coming from the implementation of digital transformation. While bigger companies are starting to understand the opportunities and challenges of the DT, SMEs are still struggling and face challenges on their path to a DT (Moeuf et al., 2017; R€ußmann et al., 2015). According to M€uller et al. (2018), SMEs approach to Industry 4.0 with MD caution and the fear that the higher transparency of the digital production process can be detrimental. The Industry 4.0 includes unprecedented developments for SMEs because of their opportunities to participate in global digital supply chains. In addition to investigations in the technical field, current research analyses how Industry 4.0 affects value creation in manufacturing, for instance how new technologies can be used to provide new services and product-service systems. Furthermore, the academic investigation on Industry 4.0 results to be extensively focussed on large enterprises (Arnold et al., 2016; Radziwon et al., 2014) and only marginally on SMEs (Schmidt et al., 2015). Yetmany large companies act as suppliers to SMEs and have SMEs as suppliers. This is the research gap that our research intends to cover. 3. Research methodology With the aim to cover the abovementioned research gap, we conduct a qualitative research about the initiative of digital transformation promoted by Smart District 4.0, a digital innovation project realized into the Apulia Region (Southern Italy) to analyse the digital transformations in the Agri–Food, Clothing–Footwear and Mechanics–Mechatronics SMEs. 3.1 Research method The paper adopts a qualitative approach based on the case study (Eisenhardt, 1989; Yin, 1984) as suitable methodology to analyse a contemporary phenomenon in its natural setting. Because the area of investigation is relatively novel, original and unique within the region considered, an extreme case study (Seawright and Gerring, 2008), the project Smart District 4.0 (www.sd40.io) is chosen. The case study methodology enables researchers to collect an extremely rich amount of qualitative data to carry out an in-depth analysis (Yin, 2003). In this light, the case study methodology rather than large-scale quantitative methods (Kodama, 2005) was considered as an appropriate research strategy specially to develop theories about a contemporary phenomenon, when the boundaries between phenomenon and context are not clearly evident, relying on several sources of evidence. As Pettigrew (1988) observed, given the limited number of cases that can usually be studied, it makes sense to choose extreme cases and polar types in which the process of interest may be clearly recognized. Finally, an inductive and open-ended research approach identifies themes from the data through several iterations with the extant literature. According to this model, the sociological phenomena cannot simply be observed but also must be interpreted by the researchers (Crotty, 1998). Thismeans that there is no one absolute reality, but different possibilities are generated by the different perspectives adopted to interpret the facts (Demartini and Paoloni, 2013). The selection of the case is based on theoretical reasons (Glaser and Strauss, 1967; Wacker, 1998) aiming to provide clear picture of the dynamics underpinning the digital transformation within the SMEs. Moreover, for its features and characteristics, this is a critical and extreme case (Eisenhardt 1989; Yin, 1984). It represents one of the most massive examples of digital-enabled transformation in SMEs belonging to three sectors: Agri–Food, Clothing–Footwear and Mechanics–Mechatronics in the South of Italy. The project has been launched on the year 2018 and received a positive evaluation by institutions such as the Italian Ministry of Economic Development (MISE). 3.2 Research context The Smart District 4.0 is a project whose aim is to support the digital transformation of the SMEs operating of three industrial sectors, such as Agri–Food, Clothing–Footwear and Mechanics–Mechatronics, geographically located in the Apulia Region, a Southern Italian region. The project is coherent with the Italian governmental a plan “Il piano Industria 4.0” launched by MISE to sustain the digital transformation of companies and launched in Impact of digital transformation of SMEs February 2017. The plan puts in place horizontal measures accessible for all enterprises with an objective to boost the investment in new technologies, research and development (R&D) and revitalize the competitiveness of Italian companies. Amongst the key strategies it is not worth to note the key role played by Digital Innovation Hub and by the eight Competence Centres launched to enhance the diffusion of Industria 4.0 within Italian companies by starting from the creation of competences for robotics, additive manufacturing, virtual reality, IoTs, cloud, big data analytics, simulation and cybersecurity. Coherently with strategic goals of the national plan, the project Smart District 4.0 focusses on the Apulia region for promoting the adoption of smart technologies and supporting the transition of the regional context towards the scenario of the digital economy. According to the Regional Innovation Scoreboard of the European Commission (EC, 2017), Apulia presents the profile of a moderate innovation region with weakness in the business R&D expenditure and overall innovation performance decreased slightly over time. The regional economy is characterized by a large coverage of a wide large spectrum of productive sectors, also with some recognized areas of specialization. Amongst them, Agri–Food, Clothing–Footwear, Mechanics–Mechatronics are some of the most recognized fields. The agro–food industry plays a crucial role in theApulia Region economy, contributing to employment and growth. Despite some recent uptake of information and communication technology (ICT) in the agro–food industry, the range of incompatible data models, ICT solutions, and business standards often hinder electronic collaboration between companies along the industry’s value chain, especially in cross-border collaboration innovation, and the ICT solutions that encourage it, have become crucial factors for retaining competitiveness. They are also essential for fostering collaboration and data exchange with related business sectors, such as logistics and transport, laboratories and certification auditors and IT companies. Currently, however, the vast potential of ICT in the agro–food industry is being underexploited. This is especially true for agro–food SMEs in the Apulian region. As for the Mechanics–Mechatronics, the Apulia region presents a strong and recognized specialization in the fields of automotive, aerospace and railway. The sector presents interesting perspectives of growth due to the presence of international industrial players, the regional technological district, a qualified offering of education at the level of secondary schools and universities. The local presence of global brands has sustained the creation of regional value chain populated by companies, in larger part SMEs, of higher specialization. Accordingly, the need emerging in this sector is from one side linked to the opportunity of creating innovative business models and value creation processes and from the other to enhance the competitiveness of the regional SMEs by developing innovative solutions, looking for a sustainable positioning in the market not necessarily dependent from the big companies. About Clothing–Footwear, the regional sector presents several areas of specialization and productions of recognized value also on international markets. The region is characterized by a long tradition in the handcrafts and high quality productions for markets’ niches. Despite this, the sector highlights the need of exploring the industrial opportunities offered by DT and to revise the strategic and organizational configuration of single company and the whole sector in an Industry 4.0 perspective. The effective implementation of DT on the value chain process in all three sectors highlights the need of creating a digital entrepreneurial culture, promoting sessions of collaborations, networking and collaborations, identifying pilot actions able to a provide a clear representation of the benefits associated to this. It is the main goal of Smart District 4.0. Specifically, Smart District 4.0 aims to overcome all these technical and organisational barriers by developing an interoperability framework to allow seamless transfer of electronic data along contributing to the development of Industry 4.0. The ultimate goal is to create an innovative digital environment that will improve the competitiveness and productivity of each industry. Table I provide a general overview about the Project Smart District 4.0 case study. MD 3.3 Data collection and analysis Data collection has been on multiple source in order to exploit the synergistic effects of combining them via triangulation (Eisenhardt, 2002) consisting in the combination of investigative techniques to reduce the bias of a single observation in comparison of multiple data (Tarrow, 1995). Data collection has been based on secondary sources such as archival records, documentary information, Smart District 4.0web page and social networks accounts. Primary source for data collection have regarded interviews (see the Appendix) with seven key informants identified into the scientific responsible of the project, top management and project managers. All the interviews to seven key informants have been anticipated by a preliminary contact via e-mail or phone call for presenting the goal of the study and the main questions included within. After this, a face-to-face meeting has been organized having the duration of 50min for informant. All the interviews have been recorded in agreement with the informant. The answers have been elaborated and sent again to the informant for their validation. For the analysis of the regional context and the collection of data about the pilot companies, a questionnaire has been implemented with three main thematic categories of questions related to the company overview, digitalization of company’s activities, software and Industry 4.0 technologies and a final fourth category. Item of the project Business process digitalisation, new business model, ICT framework, digital solutions Project Smart district 4.0, www.sd40.io Project sponsor MISE Italian ministry of economic development Project aim Literacy on collaboration platforms and technological trends (training session), analysis of the most important business processes (study stage of the feasibility conditions requirements), from new business ideas to possible solutions based on design technologies, prototype development: demonstration and validation (test of new solutions and validation in industrial contexts).

The Smart district 4.0 project at a glance Impact of digital transformation of SMEs Consistent with qualitative methodology, the process of conducting in-depth interviews was structured according to the following phases: plan, develop instrument, collect data, analyse data and disseminate findings (Boyce andNeale, 2006) to guarantee the highest degree of reliability. Myers and Avison (2002) stated that interviews offer an excellent “window” of achieving the research objectives, either to know the informant’s perspective on the issue or to know whether the informant can confirm insights and information the researchers already hold. The interviews allowed identifying andmodelling the dynamics and processes occurring amongst the different managers and entrepreneurs of SMEs involved into the project, taking into account different aspects. As argued by Gilmore et al. (1999) in case studies methodology, this approach can guarantee the highest degree of reliability. It is from this people that the required information needs to be obtained, in order to make effective the success of the investigations. Data analysis followed an inductive and iterative process (Strauss and Corbin, 1998). The first step has been a descriptive code (included in the structure of the interview itself) resulting from the theoretical framework. Lastly, we carried out the data reduction and organization of the findings. Then, we discussed our interpretation of data, seeking for the dynamics, challenges and opportunities associated to the process of digitalization into the three industrial domains of interests for the Smart District 4.0 project. Finally, as described by Eisenhardt (1989), we conducted a further series of iterations between our data, both secondary and primary and the literature on the digital transformation and SMEs, to develop the framework and better identifying the theoretical foundations of our arguments. 4. Findings The case study of Smart District 4.0 allowed to comprehend the level of engagement towards the digital transformation of Apulian SMEs operating in the agri–food, textile, clothing, footwear, mechatronics and mechanics industries. Conceived as a pivotal initiative launched in the Apulia region (Southern Italy) to sustain the introduction of DT and the process of digital transformation of SMEs in an Industry 4.0 perspective, Smart District 4.0 presents a sectorial specialization in some relevant fields of the regional competiveness and growth. All these sectors result to be critical for the development of regional context and are representative of three areas of specialization of the Apulian economy. 4.1 A four levels approach towards the digital transformation Smart District 4.0 promotes the DT of SMEs according to a methodological approach with a different and growing levels of SMEs’ engagement and impact of DT on their businessmodel, strategic and organizational setting. Four levels have been identified as a result of the research: (1) Level 1 - digital awareness: This level is grounded on the awareness about the potentiality of DT on SMEs. This level sees the participation of a larger and differentiated community of stakeholders (companies belonging to all the three industries) participation through phone calls and live meetings aimed at informing about the project and collecting subscriptions. (2) Level 2 - digital enquirement: At this level, the technological solutions at the basis of the Smart District 4.0 are presented in terms of functionalities and potentialities to sensitize SMEs and all the other stakeholders, etc. The modalities of SMEs engagement regard a more powerful interest of SMEs in the project of DT and are involved through working sessions, seminars, focus group, etc. (3) Level 3 - digital collaboration: On the basis of their interests, companies are accompanied into an activity of exploration of the potential benefits of digitalization in their own business processes and strategies. At this level, a number of limited MD companies are engaged; they are allowed to use the G Suite to sustain their administrative and communication processes. (4) Level 4 - digital transformation: This is the level of highest engagement that sees a limited number of SMEs interested in. SMEs in this level show a major interest towards the digitization process and that can represent pivotal set for the project’s goals. In this stage, the technologies made available are mainly digital solutions for production, distribution and with a more relevant impact on the company’s in terms of strategic and organizational issue for the business strategy and organizational settings. Themain DT proposed for the digitization of the three industries of the project Smart District 4.0 are synthetized in Figure 1. In Table II, the main enablers at the basis of the four levels of engagement are synthetized in terms of number of companies involved, modality of engagement, DT and solutions made available, impact at level of strategy, organizational setting, processes and expected output. The evidences presented in Table II are derived from the data collection methodology adopted. The multilevel methodology implemented by Smart District 4.0 is dynamic and its implementation is defined on the basis of the feedbacks collected in the first phases of interaction with the regional SMEs. Before starting the engagement of SMEs into the project, in the period February 2018–June 2018, an analysis of the target Apulian companies has been realized with reference to the three industries. After that, a segmentation has been conducted on the basis of target variables and dimensions (i.e. turnover minimum 3 mn). This type of segmentation has not been adopted in the industry of Mechatronics in consideration of the already complex identification phase of the SMEs belonging to this sector (fruit the fusion between the spinnerets electronics, mechanics and IT). Supply Chain Traceability (IoT, RPA, Blockchain) Precision Farming  (Machine Learning, BI&Analytics; DSS) Product-Process Maintenance  Services  (Machine Learning,  Predictive,  BI&Analytics; DSS) Smart PPE  (Workwear,  Wearable Devices, Advanced Service  Platform) Figure 1. Smart district 4.0: an industry overview of the digital technologies portfolio Impact of digital transformation of SMEs The first level of engagement (Level 1 - Digital Awareness) was oriented (to date) to a sample of about 1,000 enterprises, contacted by phone or by e-mail from researchers of the Smart District 4.0 project. Despite the item of the communication was extremely topical and growth opportunities for local businesses, most companies contacted have not expressed the consent to procedures with subsequent levels of engagement. The resistance to change on the territory is yet high. In some cases, SMEs are not fully aware about the opportunity coming from the adoption of DT for improving their productivity or to improve their processes. The second level of engagement (Level 2 - Digital Enquirement) realized through a formalized adhesion to the project and the active participation at the dissemination initiatives undertaken for presenting the solutions proposed by Smart District 4.0. Moreover, the adherents SMEs agree to participate in focus groups with the aim of sharing the peculiarities of the chains and relations existing between the different companies.

The levels of engagement towards digital transformation of Apulian SMEs MD The third level of engagement (Level 3- Digital Collaboration) works on a limited number of companies that has subscribed the project to access at the usage (at least for the duration of the project until February 2021) of the G Suite platform and start with a first process of process digitalization. The subscription of the G Suite licences allows the usage of the collaborative and digital solutions by the companies (in the field of administration, sales, procurement, marketing, etc.). Additionally, participants in this stage receive also the benefits of training sessions and assistance with a remote support service 24/7. Finally, the fourth level of engagement (Level 4 - Digital Transformation) represents the higher involvement, and it is reserved to the companies that are more interested in DT engagement and relevant for the Smart District 4.0 project. Their profile is characterized by a critical representativeness in terms of industries of interest for the project as well as for the potential innovative solutions they will be able to host. Furthermore, they are characterized by a structured and promising innovation and technological background (i.e. process and product), their perspective of growth, willingness to change, willingness a digitization of business processes, visibility company, possibility of introducing the servitization in own business model. 4.2 Digital transformations in the pilot cases Currently, four companies have been included into this fourth level of digital transformation with the aim of validating the platform Smart District 4.0 with the support of the project partner Noovle. The pilots identified to date are located, two in the Agro–Food chain, one in the Textile–Clothing–Footwear sector and one in the Mechatronics–Mechanic industry, respectively. Table III briefly describes the four selected SMEs involved into the highest level of digital transformation. The first pilot (Agro–Food) has as its object an Overall Supply Chain Traceability developed with Blockchain technology. The type of product on which one develops the application pilot is themeat. This pilot sees two actors involved very important to this supply chain, a producer that deals all stages of the supply chain from the field to packaging and a large one local operator of the Large Scale Distribution. This pilot is fully consistent with Ministerial programme about traceability that it is working regulation of this technology for the dissemination of this model as future market standards. The second pilot (Agro–Food) concerns IoT for Precision Farming (Dashboard and Analytics; DSS). This pilot could represent the implementation part ideal for validating the Smart District 4.0 platform on the area theme “IoT for precision agriculture.” The collaboration hypotheses expected the connection of the pilot and the sensor network a Smart District 4.0 platform, which would act as a collector data and would constitute a decision support system (DSS) for the users can transmit real-time decision-making to the actuation system. This allows the entrepreneur to be able to elaborate predictive analysis based on a greater amount of data with the possibility of an evaluation error very lower. The third pilot (Clothing–Footwear) concerns the application of IoT for Product–Service based on wearable devices (IoT and Service Platform). This pilot concerns two actors distinct from the industry, on the one hand, a manufacturer of garments, on the other hand, a manufacturer of products and technologies for the improvement of the quality of life. The target common is a developing data processing interface (DPI) smart prototype perfectly integrable with the various sensor system and endow it with an acquisition and control system configurable compared to certain scenery user (job security). Finally, the fourth pilot (Mechatronics) was realized within IoT for Product Predictive Maintenance (Dashboard and Analytics; DSS). The maintenance predictive is based on the identification of one or more parameters that are measured and extrapolated, using appropriate models mathematicians, to identify and manage those trends that occur before a failure or malfunction.

Table III. Impact of digital transformation of SMEs 5. Discussions Findings allow to identify a four levels approach for the understanding of digital transformation of SMEs in a regional context still characterized by limited R&D and innovation performances. It also matches the level of digitalization with SMEs’ engagement through a four levels model that moves from the digital awareness, digital enquirement, digital collaboration and finally digital transformation. In such a perspective the evidences on Smart District 4.0 represent a scalable approach at the process of digitalization of the companies able to promote patterns of iterative changeable to leverage on the organizational and strategic features (Barann et al., 2019; Lombardi et al., 2019; Urbinati et al., 2018) and make companies more competitive in the digital landscape (Frank et al., 2019; Lu et al., 2017; Bauer et al., 2015). The multilevel methodological approach adopted in the project Smart District 4.0 reserve a particular attention at the dynamics of digitalization in SMEs, mainly for what concerns the primary phase of needs’ identification and awareness creation on the potential benefits associated to theDT.Moreover, the followingphase of enquiring that is aimed to identify areas of interventions through an overview of the digital opportunities available, the phase of digital collaboration and inspiringwith pivotal tests and preliminary digital project contextualized to the firm, and the phase of digital transformation characterized by revolutionary processes in the strategic and organizational configuration of the company allow the SMEs to be included into a digital transformation roadmap starting from the different level of digital maturity of SMEs. In this perspective and for its strategic and practical implications, Smart District 4.0 results coherent with the four-stage path supporting the digital transformation as argued by Kane et al. (2019). Specifically, the levels of engagement undertaken by the Smart District 4.0 are coherent with the four phases of exploration, first implementation, transformation and aspirational digital being proposed by Kane et al. (2019). By leading SMEs into a process of growing commitment and awareness on the benefits of digitalization, Smart District 4.0 allows to overcome the timid openness to the Industry 4.0 of Apulian SMEs (M€uller et al., 2018), byworking on the creation of a new organisational culture and the analysis of costs and benefits associated to the digitalization (Mouef et al., 2017; Lu, 2017). The four pilot companies involved into the Smart District 4.0 project belong to different industries according to the requirement of the consortium. Working with the companies along the level of the proposed approach, it has been possible to verify that the first issue to solve is the resistance to change by SMEs. This makes the evidences related to the Smart District 4.0 as a contribution at the advancement of the debate on the digital transformation in the context of SMEs by leveraging on their typical characteristics in terms of flexibility, decentralization, customer proximity and lean decision-making (Li et al., 2018; Mouef et al., 2017; Cha et al., 2015). The regional context interested by Smart District 4.0 aswell as at which the pilot companies belong offers another interesting speculation for the advancement of the debate on contribution that digital innovation ecosystems can offer at the catching up of regional settings characterized by structural delays and limited investments in R&D (EC, 2017; Romano et al., 2014). SMEs need to be convinced about the benefits coming from the adoption of DT along their processes. The project manager of Smart District 4.0 has been deeply involved into the joint evaluation of scenarios of value creation with SMEs, to offer and capture final value compliant with the Industry 4.0 (M€uller et al., 2018). So, dissemination of knowledge related to the benefits emerging from DT investments, such as the Google suite and assisting with the self-assessment of companies and identifying technology needs and challenges have been the key issues addressed in the first level of digital awareness and digital enquirement. Furthermore (1) Strengthening and dissemination of technology expertise in the field of Industry 4.0; MD (2) Business orientation towards digital transformation support; (3) Facilities and technology transfer centres and (4) Stimulating the businesses and providing assistance in the realisation of the industrial research projects and experimental development. The growing intensity of change implementing into the different phases of Smart District 4.0 results also depending on the different kind of technologies adopted, since these can be opportunelymapped on the three distinctive elements defined byNambisan (2017) in terms of digital artefacts, digital infrastructures and digital platforms. 6. Conclusions and implications Smart District 4.0 is an ongoing pivotal initiative aimed to sustain the process of digitalization into the Apulian SMEs, with a specific focus on the regional sectors of Agri–Food, Clothing– Footwear and Mechanics–Mechatronics. As an extreme case study, characterised by novelty and originality, Smart District 4.0 has allowed to derive useful insights for the advancement of the debate on the challenges and opportunities of digital transformation in SMEs aswell as to identify limitations affecting this process and critical areas of interventions (M€uller et al., 2018). Smart District 4.0 has been, instead, conceived as a strategic project with meaningful relevance for the regional SMEs and a lever for the reinforcement of the competitiveness and innovation performances of the region and its successful positioning into the industrial patterns of the so-called Industry 4.0 phenomenon (Frank et al., 2019; Reischauser, 2018; Liao et al., 2017; Yin et al., 2018). Furthermore, the case of Smart District 4.0 has showed the importance of networking into the achievement of a process of digital transformation. Despite the technology being essential into such a process of digitization, critical for the successful transition of SMEs business models towards a digital configuration in coherence with the Industry 4.0 have been the human and social capitals (Frank et al., 2019). The focus on the single SME as node of a larger regional value chain, the involvement of industrial and research organizations, the principles of networking and community building that are at the basis of the Smart District 4.0 project represent further elements of strengths of this case and features of novelty in the debate on the Industry 4.0 (Arnold et al., 2016) and mainly on its meaning and dynamics for SMEs (M€uller et al., 2018). This process of collaborative and ecosystem is also coherent with the characteristics of the fourth and last stage of aspirational digital phase described by Kane et al. (2019). 6.1 Implications for theory The analysis of the case offers interesting insights about the limits and obstacles that SMEs present into the implementation of DT in their organizational and strategic models. Additionally, the paper sheds new lights on the role that key-sponsored projects by national government can provide at the achievement of a successful process of digital transformation by demonstrating that technology is necessary but not sufficient to assure it. In addition, implications for theory arise at the intersection of research streams focussed on regional development, innovation ecosystems and digital transformation. All these items disclose new roots for the development of a cross disciplinary research agenda. 6.2 Implications for practices By allowing to identify the antecedents and consequences of digitalization in the context of SMEs, mainly in terms of value drivers and process of reengineering, the paper offers several Impact of digital transformation of SMEs implications for the practice through the implementation of the methodological framework of Smart District 4.0 in SMEs. Additionally, implications arise for the agenda of policymakers in terms of definition of strategic goals and implementing initiatives with specific contextualization resulting from the correlation with regional and industrial features. 6.3 Limitations and future research The paper presents some limitations that open roots for future research. The first limitation is due to the preliminary evidences associated to the current stage of the Smart District 4.0 project. This suggests the opportunity to validate our research proposition in the ongoing development of the project also with the exploration of multiple cases related to the companies included into the phase of digital transformation and the embracement of different analytical approaches. A second limitation is linked to the context analysed in terms of SMEs, industrial domains and regional dimension. This suggests the opportunity of including into the study of different empirical sets for a compared analysis and the identification of common and distinctive features. Finally, a last limitation regards the need to develop an ad hoc dashboard or key performance indicators to assess the achievement of the SMEs towards the digital transformations. This offers an additional scenario for future studies aimed to define methodologies and tools for the dynamic measurement and the forecasting. '"

       "\"www.warwick.ac.uk/scip 1 An Industry 4 readiness  assessment tool In association with  2 An Industry 4 readiness assessment tool www.warwick.ac.uk/scip 3 Contributors Crimson & Co is a global management consultancy that specialises in the supply chain. We help clients achieve their  strategic and operational objectives, working together to transform their businesses and generate lasting change. Our  people have operational experience, are easy to work with and are trusted by clients to get the job done. Crimson & Co has  offices in London, Atlanta, Mumbai, Melbourne, São Paulo and Singapore. Supply chains constantly evolve, and Industry 4.0 is the latest step in this journey. Through the increase in digitalisation, we will  see machines and computers talking to each other to change production plans and resource usage in the most effective way  to meet changing customer demands in the most efficient manner. To achieve this and sustain it though, there will need to be  a step change in the way that companies manage their data, organise themselves, conduct their basic supply chain processes,  measure performance on both an individual and company-wide level, and share information, both internally and with supply- chain partners. These changes require not just investment in technology, but substantial cultural and capability adjustment. As experts in technical elements of the supply chain and in driving sustainable transformation, Crimson & Co works with  companies from a wide range of sectors and locations to assess the changes they need to make, design all elements of the  change required, and firmly embed the changes into their operations. Pinsent Masons is a full service, international law firm.  We respond to the pressures and opportunities facing businesses  globally with legal excellence, connectivity and collaboration. We use law and litigation strategy as a business enabler to  deliver clients a competitive edge.

As a top 75 global law firm, Pinsent Masons has just over 400 partners and 1600 lawyers operating across 22 offices  worldwide.  The quality of our lawyers is second to none.  Pinsent Masons has more Tier 1 ranked practices and top ranked  lawyers in Legal 500 and Chambers than any other UK law firm, including all 4 magic circle firms.   Businesses within the Manufacturing and Industrials sectors are well primed for growth and evolution due to the emergence  of the fourth industrial revolution. Industry 4.0 has placed an ever increasing need to embrace technology in areas such as  smart factories; 3D printing and the Internet-of-Things. However, despite its technological advantages, Industry 4.0 does  present a series of new legal challenges that need to be addressed in order to enable the sector to remain competitive in  international markets. We use our legal and commercial expertise to provide guidance that helps clients achieve competitive success, maximise  their assets and minimise complexity and risk within product lines, customer relationships, manufacturing operations  and supply chains. Our legal advice and support to clients is driven by an unparalleled understanding of the global  manufacturing market and underpinned by a presence across the UK and Europe and the Asia Pacific region. We adopt a practical, problem-centred approach to our supply chain and operations research, using supply chain strategy as  a lever for business transformation. Working with industry partners, we bring academic rigour to the resolution of complex  business and organisational problems.  The diversity of our partners means we have impact across sectors including agrochemicals, automotive, defence, consumer- packaged goods, retail, and pharmaceuticals. Current research areas include the circular economy, customer responsive  supply chains, right-shoring, data driven decision making, and offsets and economic engagement.  Our innovative research and the industrial expertise of our teaching staff, helps to inform our postgraduate education, including  both full and part-time MSc programmes. We also support PhD and EngD candidates within our expert research teams. Our Supply Chains in Practice networking events and industrial collaborator forum engage practitioners across sectors and  disciplines. Through quarterly meetings, we embed and develop customer responsive supply chain theory into practical  solutions to turn rhetoric into reality. Our collaborator forum is an invited group of forward thinking companies, whilst our  networking events are open to the wider supply chain community to attend. Industry 4: How ready is your business? The term Industry 4 originates from the high-tech strategy of the German government, which sought  to re-define the role of manufacturing post the global economic crisis. It suggests that we are on the  cusp of the 4th Industrial Revolution, a cyber physical age, which will be realised over the next 20  years.  It is an age in which materials and machines are inter-connected within the internet of things  (IoT), where everyday objects have network connectivity, allowing them to send and receive data.  This will enable highly flexible, individualised and resource friendly mass production. It is driven by a  requirement for shorter time to market, increased flexibility and greater asset efficiency.  More fundamentally it will create new business models that will drive both evolutionary and  revolutionary changes to the way in which we do business today. Businesses cannot afford to  stand-still. Based on research at WMG, the University of Warwick, in conjunction with our industrial  collaborators Crimson & Co and Pinsent Masons, an Industry 4 readiness assessment tool has been  developed. Its purpose is to provide a simple and intuitive way for companies to start to assess their  readiness and future ambition to harness the potential of the cyber-physical age.  The readiness assessment tool is comprehensive in its nature. It looks beyond the technology to  consider 6 core dimensions, with 37 sub-dimensions of industry 4 readiness. The core dimensions  include:  \\uf04b Products and services \\uf04b Manufacturing and operations \\uf04b Strategy and organisation \\uf04b Supply chain \\uf04b Business model \\uf04b Legal considerations Drawing on Crimson & Co’s expertise in developing supply chain maturity assessment tools, the  assessment is designed around four readiness levels (beginner, intermediate, experienced and  expert).  They have explicit statements of what needs to be achieved to reach that particular level of  readiness for each sub-dimension.   This report has been designed to enable you to complete a self-assessment of your company’s  current Industry 4 readiness, whilst providing a benchmark of current Industry 4 readiness across a  group of 53 companies.  The report is structured around each of the 6 core dimensions. For each dimension, there is a  detailed breakdown of the relevant sub-dimensions and descriptions for the associated maturity  levels. By circling the descriptor that best describes your company’s current level of readiness,  and using the summary templates on pages 18 and 19, you can start to build a picture of your  company’s current Industry 4 readiness. This can be repeated to reflect your company’s future  ambition, and the gaps between current and future ambition identified. The assessment can be  completed individually or as a group. It serves as a basis for enriching and expanding the discussion  to help ensure that businesses are proactively harnessing the opportunities that the cyber-physical  age presents. 4 An Industry 4 readiness assessment tool www.warwick.ac.uk/scip 5 The most commonly adopted forms of  technology were computer networks and  databases used by 70% of respondents  53 responses from 22 countries  Geographical scope  Respondents were from a broad  range of job functions  11%   Far & South East Asia 9% Australia 8% Americas 4% Middle East & Africa 43%  UK &  Ireland 25% Europe 74% of respondents were senior   management or executives  Level of management  83% of participants operated in a  B2B context, across a broad range  of 15 sectors    20 15 10 5 0 25 20 15 10 5 0 Sectors Automotiv e Biomedica l e quipment Electr ica l e quipment Energ y,  utili tie s &  m ining Fo od &  beve rag es Fu rnitu re &  home fu rnish ings Pharm ac eutic als Other Aero sp ac e, d efence  &  se cu rit y Bas ic  metal s Chemica ls Electr onics Engineerin g &  co nstr ucti on Fo rest,  pap er &  pac ka ging Industr ial  &  m ech an ica l e quipment Rubber &  plas tic  pro ducts Who completed the survey?

With the opportunity to provide greater connectivity to products through IoT technology, the cyber- physical age offers greater opportunity replace the purchase of a product with a service. HP Instant Ink is a subscription  based business model. It guarantees the user the ability to print an agreed number of pages per month, for a set fee,  and that they will never run out of ink. Pages printed, and ink usage are monitored through the IoT enabled printer. The  customer still pays for the printer, but the actual printing is a service. This service offers good value to the consumer (annual  printing costs are significantly reduced) and to the company (as they have better visibility of demand, direct relationship to  the consumer and a more consistent income stream). It also has potential benefit to the environment as recycling the ink  cartridges in a closed-loop is an integral part of the business model. It’s a win-win.  Customers value choice, and whilst some may be happy to engage with subscription based services, others will continue  to favour ownership of a physical product. There is no single right answer, but it is important for businesses to be aware of  the opportunities. HP still sells conventional printers and ink, as well as the Instant Ink service. To harness the potential of the  cyber-physical age, an understanding of the art of the possible is essential.   Sub-dimensions One of the central tenents of the Industry 4 vision, is the presumption that a ‘batch size of 1’ can be produced at the same  unit cost as a mass-produced product. This follows from the view that in the future customers will value increasing levels of  product customisation. Achieving this goal will require new approaches to the late differentiation of products. An alternative  way that this goal can be achieved is to keep the physical product base standardised, but enable the customisation of the  product through digital product features. No two smartphones, even when the brand and model are common, are the  same. They have been customised not only in terms of protection (cover, screen protector) but more fundamentally in terms  of the apps and settings. This then affords the opportunity to connect with the customer to offer data driven services. For a  smartphone this could be cloud based storage, music, maps etc. A digitally enabled device will also enable the collection of  user-data which can then be used to offer more value adding services (product data usage).  Ultimately what this can lead to  is a business model where the revenue is split between the revenue for the initial purchase of the physical product, and the  ongoing revenue from the value-adding services. The trend is for the share of revenue from data-driven services to increase.  Products and services Readiness level Level 1 Beginner Level 2 Intermediate Level 3 Experienced Level 4 Expert Product  customisation Product allows for  no individualisation,  standardised mass  production Majority of products  are made in large batch  sizes with limited late  differentiation Products can be largely  customised but still have  standardised base Late differentiation  available for most make- to-order products (batch  size 1) Digital features of  products Products show only  physical value Products show value only  from intellectual property  licensing Products exhibit some  digital features and value  from intellectual property  licensing Products exhibit high  digital features and value  from intellectual property  licensing Data-driven services Data-driven services are  offered without customer  integration Data-driven services  are offered with little  customer integration Data-driven services are  offered with customer  integration Data-driven services are  fully integrated with the  customer Level of product  data usage Data is not used 0-20% of collected data  is used 20-50% of collected data  is used More than 50% of  collected data is used Share of revenue Data-driven services  account for an initial share  of revenue (<2.5%) Data-driven services  account for a moderate  share of revenue (2.5- 7.5%) Data-driven services  account for a significant  share of revenue (7.5- 10%) Data-driven services  play an important role in  revenue (>10%) Current readiness The results of the survey identified some interesting insights into the types of practices that have currently been adopted.   In terms of product customisation 15% of companies only produced standardised products, and only 6% had late product  differentiation as the norm. The majority of businesses had a standard base to their products from which a limited form of  customisation was available. There was a distinct variation in the range of digital features in products that were offered. 28% of companies were at the  highest level of maturity, offering products with a high degree of digital features and revenue from Intellectual Property (IP)  licensing. However, at the other end of the spectrum, 36% of companies offered products with only a physical value.  Only 9% of companies offered data driven services that were fully integrated with the customer. 19% offered services with  no integration, with the vast majority offering some limited degree of customer integration.  The level of data usage had the highest overall average. Only 13% companies used no data. 17% of companies were using  more that 20% of the data they collected, and 28% more than 50%, to inform the delivery and development of value added  services.  Despite the relatively promising uptake of digital features in products, the share of revenue from data driven services is still  low. It had the overall lowest average. In 42% of companies revenue from data driven services accounts for less than 2.5% of  revenue. In only 15% of companies did it account for more than 10% of revenue.

One strategy, is to develop physical products that are customised  through the data driven services that they can support. This is the type of approach that HP and the smartphone  manufacturers have adopted. The initial sale of the product creates a degree of lock in. This can be through a one-off  purchase or longer term contract basis (e.g. smartphones are bought under contract over 12 months). This provides a base  from which to grow the revenues from the data driven services.  The alternative route is to develop more physically customisable products. This strategy may require not only a redesign of  the product, but also the technology to produce it to enable full customisation at mass-customised prices. It requires a more  fundamental rethink in the way that we design and manufacture products.  These two strategies are not mutually exclusive, and the ultimate way to harness maximum potential may be to achieve a  combination of the two. Range of readiness levels Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 4 Not relevant / no response Average readiness level 8 An Industry 4 readiness assessment tool www.warwick.ac.uk/scip 9 Industry 4: potential of technology yet to be harnessed The factory and its operation is at the heart of the vision of Industry 4. It’s a vision of fully customised products, being  autonomously produced in self-optimising factories. It’s an environment where the cyber and the physical are one. An IoT  enabled environment that allows the collection of data, that can be used to plan, optimise and control the physical operation.  Where optimisation is enabled through digital modelling using real data. This is an ambitious and far reaching vision. It has  the potential to revolutionise manufacturing, and should be a serious consideration for all manufacturing companies.  Sub-dimensions Given the origins of the concept of Industry 4 in German manufacturing strategy it is not surprising that this is the dimension  with the greatest number of sub-dimensions. The sub-dimensions can be loosely categorised into 4 key areas: \\uf084\\tTechnology integration: Automation, machine and operations system integration (M2M) \\uf084\\tAutonomous workplace: Self-optimising processes, autonomously guided workpieces \\uf084\\tData: Operations data collection, operations data usage, cloud solution usage, IT and data security \\uf084\\tResource capability: Digital modelling, equipment readiness for Industry 4 Manufacturing and operations Readiness level Level 1 Beginner Level 2 Intermediate Level 3 Experienced Level 4 Expert Automation Few machines can be  controlled through  automation Some machines and  system infrastructures can  be controlled through  automation  Most machines and  system infrastructures can  be controlled through  automation  Machines and systems can  be controlled completely  through automation  Machine and  operation system  integration (M2M) Machines and systems  have no M2M capability Machines and systems  are to some extent  interoperable  Machines and systems are  partially integrated Machines and systems are  fully integrated Equipment  readiness for  Industry 4 Significant overhaul  required to meet Industry  4 model Some machines and  systems can be upgraded Machines already meet  some of the requirements  and can be upgraded  where required Machines and systems  already meet all future  requirements Autonomously  guided workpieces Autonomously guided  workpieces are not in use Autonomously guided  workpieces are not in  use, but there are pilots  underway  Autonomously guided  workpieces used in select- ed areas Autonomously guided  workpieces are widely  adopted  Self-optimising  processes Self-optimisation   processes are not in use Self-optimising processes  are not in use, but  there are pilots in more  advanced areas of the  business  Self-optimising processes  are used in selected areas Self-optimising processes  are widely used  Digital modelling No digital modelling Some processes use  digital modelling Most processes use digital  modelling Complete digital  modelling used for all  relevant processes Operations data  collection Data is collected manually  when required, e.g.  sampling for quality  control Required data is collected  digitally in certain areas Comprehensive digital  data collection in multiple  areas  Comprehensive  automated digital data  collection across the  entire process Operations data  usage Data is only used for  quality and regulatory  purposes Some data is used to  control processes  Some data is used to  control and optimise  processes, e.g. predictive  maintenance All data is used not only  to optimise processes, but  also for decision making Cloud solution  usage Cloud solutions not in use Initial solutions planned  for cloud-based software,  data storage and data  analysis Pilot solutions  implemented in some  areas of the business Multiple solutions  implemented across the  business IT and data security IT security solutions are  planned IT security solutions  have been partially  implemented Comprehensive IT security  solutions have been  implemented with plans  developed to close any  gaps IT security solutions have  been implemented for  all relevant areas and are  reviewed frequently to  ensure compliance Current readiness The overall results of the survey indicated that this was the second lowest level of readiness. On the one hand, it is surprising  given that this represents the core of the initial Industry 4 concept. On the other, perhaps part of the challenge is the broad  range of opportunities and knowing where to start.  The survey results suggest that data has been a common starting point. Whilst companies may not be leveraging the full  range of operations data collection opportunities (average level 1.87), they are more effective at using the data they collect.  This is reflected in operations data usage having the highest average readiness level (2.45) within the manufacturing and  operations dimension. However, the potential of cloud storage usage and ensuring integrity through IT and data security,  are areas for potential improvement.  The survey also suggests that the autonomous workplace is a vision that has yet to be turned into reality. Self-optimising  processes were the lowest overall scoring sub-dimension, with only 8% of companies using them widely. The current adoption  of autonomously guided workpieces was also very low, with widespread adoption in only 9% of companies surveyed.   Resource capability is another area that has potential for development. Only 6% of companies are using a digital modelling  capability for their full range of processes. Furthermore, only 6% of companies believe that their equipment is ready for  Industry 4, with 25% indicating that significant overhaul of current assets is required.  Some progress has been made with technology integration. 21% of companies had machines that could not be controlled  through automation and no machine and operation system integration. More encouragingly, 30% of companies had the  potential for the majority of their machines to be controlled through automation. 33% of companies had either partial or full  machine and system integration.  Improving readiness Given the breadth of this dimension it is difficult to know where to begin. As a starting point, it is useful to understand the  general equipment readiness for Industry 4. This will include an assessment of the degree to which current equipment could  be controlled through automation, and integrated into the broader operating system. This may help to identify opportunities  where data could be collected and used to improve the optimisation of current processes. To ensure this is done in a secure  way, it is essential to fully consider the IT and data security implications from the start.  For some the fully autonomous workplace may be a distant vision, but it is good to have a view of what that vision could be  and the potential benefits. As technology becomes cheaper that vision may be closer to reality than it seems.

How will it impact our business strategy? What are the short-term investment requirements and  opportunities for my business?”.  Some also ask whether the term is simply hype. These mixed reactions show a digitalisation  concept is recognised by industrial leaders, but that they are some way from embedding it into the business strategy and  culture.  Industry 4 moves us into a world where computers and machines talk to each other, share data, and based on this  information, change what they are going to do to make production more efficient and better meet the company’s objectives.  This will lead to a major cultural change, with the nature of current jobs, decisions being made, and data being available and  reviewed all evolving considerably.  Sub-dimensions The strategy and organisation section covers seven sub-dimensions assessing the implementation of Industry 4 with required  ways of working, measurements, and investment in business functions and capabilities.    The topic inevitably occupies a leading position on the agenda of directors and senior executives, as it will fundamentally  transform the way businesses work. It is critical that leadership teams understand the potential benefits to be realised and are  developing plans to invest. However, successful implementation of Industry 4 requires far more than the senior leadership  team paying lip-service to it by purchasing new technology. It also requires cross-functional support by the adoption of  relevant measurements and collaborative ways of working, at both strategic and operational level. Departments will need to  be open to cross-company collaboration to drive improvements. Businesses will need employees with the right digital knowledge and capabilities to convert the strategy into actions, and  investment in capabilities must be part of the agenda. It is clear that businesses are expecting to see the benefits of Industry  4, therefore it is important to ensure appropriate measurements are in place to track the return on investment as well as the  effectiveness of the transformation.   Businesses have to embed the concept of Industry 4 across business functions and levels, ensuring that internal KPIs and the  cross functional collaborations are consistent to drive better adoption and financial returns.

When measured, the Strategy and Organisation segment has the lowest maturity level of all areas in the  survey: \\uf084\\tLeadership recognises the benefits of Industry 4, but it is a long way from turning it into a way of life  \\uf084\\tCompanies and functions that depend on technology are the most advanced, but overall a lack of digital culture and  skills exists even across these organisations \\uf084\\tLimited business measures are in place to reflect the true total cost of ownership vs. business benefits \\uf084\\tPersonal performance measurements aren’t driving Industry 4 adoption So, leadership claims to recognise the benefits, and is planning to invest. In technological areas this is happening, but overall  evidence suggests actions are not speaking louder than words, and calls into question the real level of commitment to  Industry 4. There is limited measurement of returns (despite being prepared to invest large sums); personal indicators do not  drive inter-departmental collaboration, (even though integrated working is key to any company achieving its overall strategic  goals), and despite the new skills and approach required, there are few structured training programmes for existing staff.    Improving readiness A successful transformation of Industry 4 will bring tangible financial benefits by reducing operating costs and improving  business efficiency, as well as other less quantifiable benefits such as being recognised as a brand that is innovative and  market leading.  Implementation is major change project, and is not something that can be concentrated on for a couple of years, and then  assumed to be “done”. It must become the bedrock of how the company works, and how its processes are structured.  It will require a strong commitment to invest, not just in the technology and IT equipment, but more importantly in process,  people and culture. While digital technologies are rapidly becoming a commodity, success largely depends on an  organisation’s digital capability and skills, and its leaders’ commitment to define, lead, and communicate the transformation.  To conclude, the transformation of Industry 4 takes time and concentration. To be successful it is critical for the industry  leaders to: \\uf084\\tDrive cultural change. It is about using increasingly intelligent processes and the freedom to make decisions to  accelerate business strategy and organisation goals \\uf084\\tUnderstand the readiness from the strategy and organisation perspective for a revolutionary change. The maturity levels  are differentiated by the depth and breadth of interactions across business functions \\uf084\\tAlign functional and department goals and strategies with business strategy. Leaders need actively to support the  change, and individual and organisational measurements need to drive the right behaviours \\uf084\\tEnsure the right capabilities and equipment are invested in, and sustained through constant training, process  monitoring and technological enhancement Range of readiness levels Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 4 Not relevant / no response Average readiness level www.warwick.ac.uk/scip 1312 An Industry 4 readiness assessment tool Supply chain integration: the secret success factor of Industry 4    If the vision of Industry 4 is to be realised, most business processes and systems must become fully digitalised. Many industry  leading companies have taken the step to implement advanced technology across their supply chains to improve visibility  and bring down the walls between different business functions.   However, research shows that one of the biggest challenges in Industry 4 implementation does not lie in how companies  apply individual technologies or make improvements in single business functions, but in how effective they are at developing  an integrated supply chain approach that connects with suppliers and customers. This is the only way to fully exploit the  potential that Industry 4 offers.  Achieving full digital collaboration and then using it effectively throughout the supply chain requires all companies involved  to develop processes, capabilities and systems to support them. Culturally they must develop the responsibility and trust to  openly share accurate information in a timely manner and with many outside their own organisational boundaries. For many  companies, this requires a maturity far beyond that exhibited in their traditional supplier and customer relationships. Sub-dimensions Industry 4 not only involves the digitalisation of horizontal and vertical value chains, but will also revolutionise the product  and service portfolio of companies, with the goal of better satisfying customer needs in a cost-effective method. To ensure  that customers will benefit from better services and flexibility, businesses will need to be capable of immediately responding  to changes in market environment and individual customer requirements. Traditionally, better supply chain agility could  mean shorter lead time and more flexibility in service, but it could also mean more inventory and higher end to end supply  chain costs.   The implementation of Industry 4 can make a revolutionary change to that traditional approach, by giving better visibility of  upcoming demand and inventories throughout the supply chain. Having real-time information about site location, capacity,  inventory and operations throughout supply chain enables better response to customers’ needs. This information sharing  enables supply chain integration, so facilitating a more agile response from upstream suppliers to downstream logistics  providers, driving efficiencies and improved service throughout the supply chain.

But these approaches are just the  beginning. Real-time, high quality information is being used predominantly to drive segmented business decisions, with very  limited sharing and integration with suppliers and customers.  Data lies at the heart of Industry 4, but the massively growing information flow brings little value unless it is accurate  (“garbage in, garbage out” becomes even more relevant as the quantity and reliance on systems to drive decision making  grows); timely (both provided on time, and even if it comes from different sources, covering the same period); and is  deployed intelligently (those who need to know are informed, but different elements of the supply chain are not swamped  with a meaningless volume of data, that obscures what really matters).  Greater integration of data throughout the supply chain brings new collaboration opportunities. Sharing and using  information intelligently allows suppliers to help manufacturers in production and inventory planning, driving efficiencies  in both the manufacturer’s and customer’s operations. Many companies claim to have such collaborative opportunities in  sight, but over 30% of companies in our survey claimed no integration with suppliers or customers. Maybe this 30% are  more honest than the remaining 70%, not necessarily in terms of whether they are trying to collaborate, but in terms of how  effective they are at it.  This is because, as highlighted in the survey, many respondents say their companies have ad-hoc basic communications with  suppliers and customers, most of the time when there is a risk to service, followed by short term mitigation actions which  potentially have an impact on other parts of the supply chain.  There are other benefits of supply chain integration that far fewer companies have on their radar. These include better  service and maintenance of companies’ assets and products held by suppliers, and better cooperation and decision-making  with customers. These open possibilities for new service offerings and ways of working, and business leaders need to get  there ahead of competitors. To succeed, companies will need to share and use information in a forward-looking way that  integrates the supply chain. These ad-hoc approaches to supply chain integration or visibility are part of what is inhibiting companies’ journeys to  Industry 4 implementation.  Range of readiness levels Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 4 Not relevant / no response Average readiness level Improving readiness The absence of a digital culture and capabilities were identified as a top challenge in Industry 4 implementation. The  secret success factor of Industry 4 is to embed the concept of supply chain integration into the hearts and minds of the  organisation, and all those up and down the supply chain; moving beyond ad-hoc approaches and distrust. This requires an  aligned understanding of the capability levels, business process gaps, and systems both internally and across suppliers and  customers, and adopting a culture in all elements of the relationship to promote an effective collaborative approach.   The secret success factor of Industry 4 lies in an integrated supply chain approach connecting parties throughout the supply  chain. To be successful, it is critical for industry leaders to:  \\uf084\\tDevelop an integrated supply chain approach, allowing intelligent information sharing and communication with  suppliers and customers, to drive agility and efficiency \\uf084\\tDemonstrate to all participants that the benefits of integration will be shared, and the knowledge gained not used  adversely against the weaker players in the supply chain \\uf084\\tIdentify and gather real-time information using advanced technologies, deploying it for the right purposes and  effectively analysing it to make the right decisions \\uf084\\tEmbed a culture of integration within the business and all those involved in the supply chain www.warwick.ac.uk/scip 1514 An Industry 4 readiness assessment tool ‘As a service’  business  model Industry 4: an opportunity for business model innovation Whilst its roots may be in the domain of the factory, the most significant opportunity that Industry 4 presents is  to redefine the way we do business. It provides the opportunity for businesses to evolve their current business  model. For instance, the way in which catalogue based retailers have capitalised on the opportunity to move their  businesses online. Equally, it can be more revolutionary in nature. The advent of ‘market mediators’ (platforms that  provide visibility and matching of demand and supply) are disrupting traditional markets. Prominent examples  include Airbnb, ebay, Uber and Whim.  It is critical for businesses to ensure that their business model is contemporary and regularly refreshed. It is equally  important to consider the opportunities that Industry 4 presents in terms of developing a company’s own business  model as well as the potential threat of new disruptive entrants.  Sub-dimensions The blurring of the lines between products and services has implications for business model design, and has seen  a proliferation of ‘as a service’ business models. The UK has seen a shift from outright car ownership (a product),  to a service.  A monthly payment secures dedicated access to a car, for a set number of miles per year with agreed  maintenance and breakdown recovery. The next stage in the evolution is the view of ‘mobility as a service’ which  questions the need for dedicated access to a car. Such provisions can be dependent on the real-time tracking of  the product, and the real-time and automated scheduling of maintenance activities. For instance, protecting the  residual value of a car on a monthly service plan, requires the appropriate maintenance regime. It could be further  enhanced if data driven decisions could be taken on which maintenance activities to carry out. Such business  models breakdown the traditional view of routes to market and customer touchpoints, and require more integrated  marketing channels. IT supported business, where IT systems support and integrate all company processes will be  fundamental to harnessing the potential of Industry 4.

IT supported business  is a critical enabler to the development of new business models.  40% of companies reported full IT support for their  processes, with 19% achieving full integration. This is important as such a full and integrated IT backbone is essential for data  driven decisions. This was the highest ranking sub-dimension. Whilst only 9% are using all relevant data to inform business  decisions, 21% are using most data and a further 25% some data.  The sub-dimensions with lowest readiness related to the real-time tracking of products, and real-time and automated  scheduling. Surprisingly, for both sub-dimensions over 25% of companies did not see the relevance to their business. Only  8% of companies were able to track the product across the complete lifecycle or automatically diagnose and schedule  maintenance. 19% of companies had limited product racking, and 21% independent manual maintenance schedules.  Integrated marketing channels and customer touch points remains an area for improvement, with only 8% of companies  having fully integrated customer experience management across all channels. The majority (36%) had integration within their  offline and online channels, but not between them.   ‘As a service’ business models are in their infancy. 17% of companies had implemented this offering, although the majority  (45%) were aware of the concept and had some initial plans for development, whilst 34% had no awareness.   Improving readiness A two-prong approach to improving the readiness of the business model dimension is suggested.  The first-prong focuses  on the improvement of the current business model. Companies can continue to invest and leverage the IT support that  is required to support and integrate current processes. This provides a strong platform from which the business start to  utilise data to make more evidence based business decisions. This could also help to deliver a more integrated customer  experience across all channels, removing the divide between offline and online.  In parallel companies need to look to the future and consider alternative business models (e.g. ‘as a service’) and what this  could mean to their business. This could drive (where appropriate) the business case for investment in technology to enable  more real-time tracking and scheduling.

It has long been recognised (though perhaps not always adopted) that the  early involvement of manufacturing and supply chain in the new product development process is essential for successful  commercialisation of new products.  For companies to successfully evolve their business practice to harness the full potential  of Industry 4, much earlier consideration of the legal aspects will also be required. Early identification of the legal issues such  a transformation presents, will promote innovation within the legal profession to find effective ways to handle these issues.  Sub-dimensions Four legal dimensions for assessment were identified: contracting models, legal risk, data and intellectual property. These  dimensions pose the areas of greatest legal risk but also of greatest opportunity when handled in the most effective way.  These are areas on which companies are beginning to focus their attention.  As a result of the adoption of Industry 4 contracting models are being challenged, particularly the traditional linear models.  However, there is a need for both cultural and legal change to move to more collaborative arrangements, often between  more than two parties, with openness to the sharing of both risk and reward.   In the area of legal risk there are multiple risks to be considered. The readiness assessment focuses on the overarching  consideration of legal risk and considers both the key measure of risk awareness and the actions required to address such  risks. The generation and flow of data is a fundamental element of Industry 4 and an enabler for the creation of value. However,  the appropriate protection and use of data (both proprietary and third party owned) is essential both to the functioning of  Industry 4 and to the realisation of the value of the data.   The identification, protection and exploitation of intellectual property has always been of utmost importance to companies to  distinguish their products and services from those of competitors. The adoption of Industry 4 brings these issues in to sharp  focus and expands the range of rights to be considered, in particular the interaction with third party intellectual property  rights.  Legal considerations Readiness level Level 1 Beginner Level 2 Intermediate Level 3 Experienced Level 4 Expert Contracting models Contracting processes are  linear and unchanged Some changes to  contracting processes  to reflect operational  changes Some 'flagship' projects  utilise new contracting  models but it is not  standard across the board All contracting is  behavioural and  incentivises all parties to  achieve the best result Risk New risks not identified or  assessed New risks identified  and/or assessed but no  mitigations planned New risks identified and  assessed, and limited  mitigations put in place Working party has  assessed the changing  risk profile and has  procedures in place to  mitigate these Data protection No data protection  policies or procedures Have internal policies but  do not ensure compliance  in engagement with  suppliers/customers  Good understanding  with robust policies and  procedures but haven't  updated for General Data  Protection Regulation Conducted a recent  General Data Protection  Regulation audit and are  confident of compliance  including in light of  Industry 4 Intellectual property Intellectual property  in new products and  services is not identified  or protected  Awareness of intellectual  property in new products  and services, but no legal  protections identified or  applied for Intellectual property in  products and services  is identified and in part  assessments made as to  whether registrations/ contractual rights  required, and if required,  appropriate steps taken  Intellectual property in  products and services  is identified and  assessments made as to  whether registrations/ contractual rights  required and, if required,  appropriate steps taken 0 Risk Contracting  models  Data  protection Intellectual  property 20 40 60 80 100 Percentage Su b- di m en sio n 4 3 2 1 Intellectual  property Risk Data  protection Contracting  models  Range of readiness levels Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 4 Not relevant / no response Average readiness level Current readiness The results of the survey demonstrated noticeably different results in relation to each legal dimension.   Contracting models – 50% of respondents indicated that their contracting behaviours remained unchanged.  Whilst this may  not present an immediate legal risk, it is likely to result in missed commercial opportunities. The greatest opportunities from  the adoption of Industry 4 will require contracting models providing for greater collaboration and partnership models. There  will be much broader scope to embrace the benefits of Industry 4 and develop more fruitful relationships within supply  chains if contracting models become less linear and more flexible or collaborative. Legal risks – Most surprisingly, 54% of respondents had not considered nor addressed legal risks.  They were not aware of  the nature of the “lurking” legal risks presented by Industry 4. Lack of awareness of the risks results in the maximum scope  for exposure to such risks. It is also very difficult for the Board of these businesses to take informed decisions in relation to  “unknown unknowns”. Data protection – The responses to the data questions were considerably more positive.  Whilst 11% had no policies  or procedures in relation to the handling of data, 32% had a good understanding and robust policies and procedures  for adherence.  However, it is notable that only 9% had conducted an audit of their data processing activities and had  confidence in their meeting the legal requirements for data use/protection compliance. Intellectual property – The intellectual property results were even better. Only 13% of respondents had not identified or  protected the intellectual property in their products and services. Encouragingly 30% had identified, assessed and taken  appropriate steps to secure protection. Yet the extent of the intellectual property Industry 4 issues does not appear to be  fully understood, in particular the increased need to share and secure licences of third party intellectual property. Improving readiness Industry 4 is the number one technology trend impacting business strategy. To benefit from the opportunities and improve  the level of Industry 4 maturity the legal risks must be clearly understood at board level.   It is perhaps the publicity and perceived value around both data and intellectual property which resulted in respondents to  the survey having identified and started to address these issues. However, it is clear that there is a lot more to be done to  increase the breadth and depth of awareness of all of these dimensions and the legal challenges/potential pitfalls.   As well as increasing awareness of the issues, the boards need to understand the necessary investment, planning and actions  required to successfully address them. In particular the effective handling of such issues should be seen as enablers and not  barriers.  Businesses’ ability to understand the types of collaborative contracts which can be achieved will assist them in entering  arrangements set to achieve greater gains for all involved. Anticipating the legal risks and liabilities will enable manufacturers  to plan for and successfully navigate the potential difficulties. Having the confidence to handle data in a legally compliant  manner will reap greater rewards. Anticipating intellectual property challenges enables businesses to reach more beneficial  arrangements with third parties.   However, the responsibility does not only rest with business. The current legal environment leaves a number of the  implications of these legal dimensions uncertain. For example, liability for the use of unreliable or corrupted data or for the  decisions of robots is subject to great debate and some reluctance to adopt new technologies. Government, and legislators  must invest in the provision of greater legal certainty around some of these difficult issues to counter the related reluctance  to prepare and engage fully with Industry 4. 18 An Industry 4 readiness assessment tool www.warwick.ac.uk/scip 19 Industry 4 readiness self-assessment templates  These templates will help to document and benchmark your company’s current level of Industry 4 readiness.  For each of the  6 dimensions, use the readiness assessment criteria to identify your current level of readiness (1,2,3 or 4) for each of the sub- dimensions. Transfer these levels to the summary tables below. If a sub-dimension is not relevant, then mark it as NR.  Repeat  the exercise to document your future ambition.  You can then benchmark your company results by plotting the score for your current Industry 4 readiness on the relevant  spidergram and joining them together. In a different colour, repeat for future ambition to highlight the gap between current  readiness and future ambition.
