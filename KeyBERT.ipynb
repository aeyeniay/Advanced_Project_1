The main objective is to promote education and equal opportunities in cooperation with the “Fritz Henkel Stiftung” foundation.“Habitat for Humanity”Together with Habitat for Humanity, teams of Henkel employees have been building houses for families in need since 2014. During a week-long  “building trip” in April 2017, Henkel employees helped build a new house for families in need near the Romanian port of Constanta. As part of the “Welcome Home” program, a team of Henkel employees from the Adhesives for Consumers, Craftsmen and Building business area volunteered to spend one week helping to construct multi-family houses for people in need in Macedonia during September. Henkel also supports these activities with dona-tions in kind, for example with building materials.Integration through internshipsIn 2017, we once again focused on the integration of refugees. Together with other companies, as well as the German Federal Employment Agency, Henkel is assisting less-qualified refugees in Germany in taking their first steps into the world of work. In the “Praktikum PLUS Direkt einstieg” pilot project, participants learn practical skills and gain knowledge to prepare them for a future job. They also attend language classes and integration courses.In 2016, Henkel launched a comprehensive program for integrating refugees at its vocational training center in Düsseldorf. In coopera-tion with external partners, as well as authorities, the company pro-vides refugees with career orientation and job shadowing opportuni-ties, internships, coaching, and access to language programs that run for several months. The objective is to support the integration of peo-ple who have high prospects of remaining, at all levels.Get out of the daily office routine and work together to support those in need: With this in mind, around 20 motivated Henkel employees flew to Romania for a “building trip”. For one week they helped build new homes for families.Ahmad Shah Rahmani (right) is a participant in the “Praktikum PLUS Direkteinstieg” integration pro-gram. He has been working for Henkel since March 2017 in Infra-structure  Services. His colleague Andre  Terporten (left) and super-visor Michael  Roling are happy to have him in their team. 126Henkel Sustainability Report 2017 Foreword Henkel overview Our strategy Management Purchasing and   supplier management Production Logistics and transport Sustainability stewardship Adhesive Technologies Beauty Care Laundry & Home Care People Social engagement Stakeholder dialog External assessments Indicators Scope and reference frameworkImprintAnnexHenkel Sustainability Report 2017  Foreword Henkel overview Our strategy Management  Purchasing and  supplier management Production Logistics and transport Sustainability stewardship Adhesive Technologies Beauty Care Laundry & Home Care People Social engagement Stakeholder dialog External assessments Indicators Scope and reference frameworkImprintAnnex\\x0c03\\n\\n“Creating sustainable value – \\nour purpose at Henkel – is  \\nboth the essence of our \\n heritage and the ambition \\nthat guides our actions.”\\n\\nKathrin Menges \\nExecutive Vice President Human Resources  \\nand\\xa0Chair of Henkel’s Sustainability Council\\n\\nWe want to create sustainable value through our business activities – \\n\\nWe can look back on continued progress and success in the area of \\n\\nfor our customers, employees, shareholders and society.

We want to create more value – for our customers \\n\\nand consumers, our employees, our shareholders, for the communities \\n\\nwe operate in, and for our company – while reducing our environ\\xad\\n\\nmental footprint at the same time. We aim to pioneer new solutions \\n\\nfor sustainable development while continuing to shape our business \\n\\nresponsibly and increasing our economic success. Our sustainability \\n\\nstrategy provides a clear framework for this aim and reflects the high \\n\\nexpectations of our stakeholders.\\n\\nWe are facing immense challenges. Humankind already has a global \\n\\nenvironmental footprint that is greater than the planet’s resources \\n\\ncan sustain. By the year 2050, the world’s population is expected \\n\\nto\\xa0grow to nine billion. The accompanying acceleration in global \\n\\n economic activity will lead to rising consumption and resource \\n\\ndepletion. As a result, competition for resources will intensify in the \\n\\ncoming decades. For this reason, we need innovations, products and \\n\\ntechnologies that enhance quality of life while consuming less input \\n\\nmaterials. We aim to use our decades of experience in sustainability \\n\\nto develop and implement solutions that are fit for the future together \\n\\nwith our partners. Our long\\xadterm goal is to triple the value we create \\n\\nthrough our business operations in relation to the environmental \\n\\nfootprint of our products and services by 2030.

The new \\nspray pump design saves more than \\n450\\xa0metric tons of plastic material per \\nyear, which corresponds to savings of \\n900\\xa0metric tons of crude oil.\\n\\nThe PET shampoo bottles used for the \\nSyoss hair care range are made of \\n25\\xa0percent recycled PET and save \\n167\\xa0metric tons of new PET material. \\nThe carbon footprint of recycled PET \\nplastic is 80 percent lower than that of \\ncomparable new material.\\n\\nBoth the bottle used for Pattex Made at \\nHome all-purpose glue and the adjust-\\nable applicator nozzle for filigree and \\nwide-area gluing are made of 100 per-\\ncent recycled material.\\n\\n1. Less packaging and waste\\n\\nReducing packaging material or avoiding it completely is the best \\n\\nway to minimize waste and thus negative environmental effects. This \\n\\nis why we aim to do away with all packaging that is not absolutely \\n\\nessential. We continually strive to reduce the quantity of packaging \\n\\nmaterial in the entire product life cycle without impacting the quality, \\n\\nperformance, or safety of our products. Packaging is designed in \\n\\nsuch\\xa0a way that it delivers the performance expected by the consumer \\n\\nwhile using the least possible amount of materials. To achieve this \\n\\ngoal, our packaging engineers work closely with partners along the \\n\\nentire value chain, so they can make use of leading design techniques, \\n\\nmodern production technologies and advanced materials in the \\n\\ndevelopment process. For example, we cooperate with external \\n\\nresearch institutions on an ongoing basis to develop packaging \\n\\n formats that offer the consumer the same quality with less material.\\n\\n2. Better packaging\\n\\nThe most widely used packaging materials made from renewable raw \\n\\nmaterials are paper and cardboard. We want to continually increase \\n\\nour use of these materials. We also test and assess new packaging \\n\\nmaterials, such as bioplastics.

Con\\xad\\n\\nsumers of the lowest income level, for example, buy small units as \\n\\nsoon as they have enough money available to do so. We take this \\n\\ninto account when planning pack sizes. In Latin America, for exam\\xad\\n\\nple, we put our Pril dishwashing liquid on the market in a pack size \\n\\nof 30 milliliters, which is available in retail at a price equivalent to \\n\\n10 cents. The same applies to our Mas laundry detergent in Mexico. \\n\\nIn the South American market, we offer deodorant creams and \\n\\nshampoos in small retail units of between 10 and 20 milliliters.\\n\\n•  Locally adapted products: Different regional conditions may also \\n\\nrequire the adaptation of our product formulations.

With the goal of promoting committed and agile teamwork, there \\nwas a comprehensive program of activities with different areas of focus \\nevery day.

With our Global Diversity & Inclusion policy, \\n\\ncally, we use mentoring in different business units and countries  \\n\\nwe\\xa0have promised to further strengthen diversity and appreciative \\n\\nto promote knowledge transfer and a change of perspective \\n\\nbehavior at Henkel. We want to create an inclusive working environ\\xad\\n\\nbetween experienced and less experienced employees. Societal \\n\\nment that fosters all dimensions of diversity. We pursue a holistic \\n\\nchanges, such as the aging population in industrialized countries, \\n\\napproach, which includes individual personal characteristics as well \\n\\npose substantial challenges for companies. To address this demo\\xad\\n\\nas experience, knowledge, and skills. Examples are:\\n\\ngraphic development, Henkel, in collaboration with the Rhenish\\xad \\n\\nWestphalian Technical University in Aachen, Germany, has devel\\xad\\n\\noped a \\n\\n  “demography radar,” which we can use to simulate the \\n\\nage structure of our workforce in Germany under particular condi\\xad\\n\\ntions. With this information, we can better meet the challenges \\n\\nposed by demographic changes. We also offer our employees a wide \\n\\nrange of programs for \\n\\n  maintaining health. \\n\\nTo appreciate our diversity and strengthen our global team spirit, Henkel \\n– inspired by a Danish commercial – carried out a small video experiment: \\nWe asked our employees personal questions and found out what connects \\nus all.

The semi-retirement model enables our employees \\ninvolved in shift work and in the fire service at all German sites to move \\ngradually away from shift work, which increasingly takes its toll over the \\nyears. At the same time, we encourage the targeted training of qualified \\nyoung people by having their experienced colleagues coach them in direct \\npreparation for a specific role. This ensures that we keep many years of \\nknowledge within Henkel and improves the company‘s future viability.\\n\\n•  Life stages: Our employees are defined by their education, career \\n\\npaths, and social relationships in different life stages. The resulting \\n\\nactivities and obligations pose the challenge of combining  personal \\n\\nand working life in a reasonable way. We support our employees by \\n\\noffering them \\n\\n  flexible working models. We also actively help \\n\\nfamilies in achieving a work\\xadlife balance, for example, through the \\n\\nprovision of childcare and our \\n\\n  social services. \\n\\n•  Gender: Our goal is to continually increase the share of female \\n\\n representation at all levels of the organization. To do so, we use \\n\\n targeted measures in employee acquisition and development. \\n\\nWe support the career development of women at all management \\n\\nlevels worldwide. In 2017, the proportion of women in management \\n\\npositions was around 34.5 percent. \\n\\n•  Cultures: An international workforce composed of people with \\n\\n different cultural backgrounds is important in a global company \\n\\nlike Henkel, as it enables us to develop an understanding of our \\n\\nmarkets. In order to meet the challenges of mixed teams, we provide \\n\\nintercultural training courses and workshops. These aim to increase \\n\\nawareness of different value systems and their influence on our \\n\\ndaily behavior. Henkel also encourages international transfers \\n\\nwithin employees’ career paths. The experiences thus gathered \\n\\nopen up new ways of thinking. With employees from a total of \\n\\n120\\xa0countries, cultural diversity is a part of everyday working life \\nat\\xa0Henkel. 66\\xa0countries are represented at the corporate head\\xad\\nquarters in Düsseldorf alone.\\n\\nReliable childcare is a decisive factor in achieving a work-life balance for \\nworking parents. Henkel offers counseling and support to its employees \\nreturning to work from parental leave in many countries to help them  \\nfind suitable childcare facilities. At the Düsseldorf site there are 240 childcare \\nplaces in three nurseries. In 2015, the first Henkel company daycare \\n center outside of Germany was opened in Bratislava, Slovakia. Childcare \\nplaces for 100 children from two\\xa0years of age were created here.\\n\\nHenkel Sustainability Report 2017 Foreword Henkel overview Our strategy Management Purchasing and   supplier management Production Logistics and transport Sustainability stewardship Adhesive Technologies Beauty Care Laundry & Home Care People Social engagement Stakeholder dialog External assessments Indicators Scope and reference frameworkImprintAnnex\\x0c114\\n\\nIntegrating people with disabilities \\n\\nDialog and culture\\n\\nAt Henkel, we foster a culture of inclusion which focuses on the skills \\n\\nand individual talents of people with disabilities.

In 2017, we introduced a new interactive \\n\\nformat to communicate and deepen the understanding of our key \\ninitiatives and corporate values. The Henkel 2020+ talks are a series \\n\\nof events that deal with strong ideas on a wide range of topics relat\\xad\\n\\ning to our strategic priorities, projects, and values. Using concrete \\n\\nexamples and personal anecdotes, selected management personnel \\n\\nprovide in\\xaddepth insights into the most important topics for Henkel. \\n\\nIn the talks, the speakers get to the heart of the issues and then \\n\\nengage in an open and interactive dialog with the employees – either \\n\\nin person or via Skype. After successful kick\\xadoff events in  Düsseldorf \\n\\nwith international participation, the talks were held in  Stamford \\n\\nSurvey on Henkel 2020+\\nAbout six months after the introduction of Henkel 2020+, we invited our \\nmanagers to participate in a survey. The objective was to measure their \\nunderstanding of our strategic priorities and ambitions and then to further \\nimprove our communication and engagement activities based on this feed-\\nback. The response rate was 45 percent, with very positive results over-\\nall. Understanding of and commitment to all the elements of our strategy \\nwas well above 90 percent and outperformed external benchmarks. The \\nfact that 80 percent of all managers who responded described their perso-\\nnal contribution in detail is also evidence of this clear understanding. A \\nkey finding was the effectiveness of personal communication: Most of the \\n participating managers learned about Henkel 2020+ at the town hall \\n meetings of the Management Board or at management conferences. This \\nunderscores the unchanged importance of personal communication in  \\nparallel with the trend toward digitalization and new media formats.\\n\\nand Rocky Hill, Connecticut, USA , and broadcast around the world.\\n\\nEmployee representation\\n\\nOur various employee representative bodies play a key role. An \\n\\nin\\xaddepth exchange of views and consultations with the management \\n\\ntake place both at the operational level, for example, with the local \\n\\nworks councils, and across companies with the trade union. We \\n\\ninform our employee representatives regularly and on a timely basis \\n\\nand give them as much detail as possible, for example, regarding the \\n\\ncorporate strategy or planned acquisitions. In countries where no \\n\\nemployee representation is planned or established, the social dialog \\n\\nwith the respective management serves as a voluntary and informal \\n\\ninstrument for close exchange. This enables us to improve communi\\xad\\n\\ncation with our employees, include their perspectives early on, and \\n\\njointly shape future\\xadoriented issues. That helps Henkel avoid conflicts \\n\\nof interest and strengthens employee identification with the company. \\n\\nWith the Henkel 2020+ talks, we inspired more than 5,000 employees to \\nimplement Henkel’s strategic priorities, projects, and values in their daily \\nprofessional lives.\\n\\nHenkel Sustainability Report 2017 Foreword Henkel overview Our strategy Management Purchasing and   supplier management Production Logistics and transport Sustainability stewardship Adhesive Technologies Beauty Care Laundry & Home Care People Social engagement Stakeholder dialog External assessments Indicators Scope and reference frameworkImprintAnnex\\x0c116\\n\\nEmployee representation plays a particularly important role in \\n\\nEurope. In 1995, Henkel was one of the first German companies to \\n\\nvoluntarily set up a European Works Council (EWC) to continue \\n\\nthe\\xa0successful cooperation between management and employee \\n\\n representatives at the European level. Through the EWC, Henkel \\n\\ninforms the representatives of its European companies about matters \\n\\nsuch as the economic situation, transnational initiatives of the com\\xad\\n\\npany such as restructuring or reorganization programs, safety, health \\n\\nand the environment, and training and development programs. \\n\\nIn Germany, Henkel also involves employee representatives in many \\n\\ndecision\\xadmaking processes beyond those for which worker participa\\xad\\n\\ntion is a statutory requirement. In May 2017, Henkel’s Works Council \\n\\ncelebrated its 100th anniversary in Düsseldorf.

Since 2013, at our corporate headquarters in Düssel-\\ndorf, we have been implementing a demography program after a success-\\nful pilot phase. This holistic concept includes a combination of preventive \\noccupational healthcare with a general medical check-up, workability \\nindex, and employee interviews. From this we can derive profiles of indivi-\\ndual employees’ strengths and weaknesses as well as those of the relevant \\norganizational unit. Employees can be informed of the individual actions \\nthey need to take to improve and maintain their health and performance. \\nPlant managers can see the need to take operational measures with regard \\nto workplace design, continuing education, and optimizing the organiza-\\ntion of work and the working atmosphere. This supports them in develop-\\ning their teams. Since 2016, the businesses have been repeating the pro-\\ngram, as a result of which they can evaluate the development and success \\nof the measures.

As \\npart of this, an interactive eLearning module has been developed that can \\nbe accessed worldwide by all employees with computer access.

The focus here is on \\n\\nmutual encouragement to develop a\\xa0safety culture, as well as on \\n\\n constructive feedback about unsafe behaviors. In 2017 alone, around \\n\\n42,000 dialogs of this kind were held worldwide.

Selected contributions \\nwere posted on the site’s notice board so that all employees could read them.\\n\\nOne of the entries in the video competition featured a yellow handprint \\nrepresenting a fish. This yellow fish has become the symbol of the cam-\\npaign for the safety of our hands. At the different sites, the yellow fish \\nwas\\xa0used to announce the presentation of the final version of the film. \\nIn\\xa0addition, our employees shared the yellow fish online in our Yammer \\nnetwork – virtually floating around the world and spreading awareness of \\nthe value of our hands.\\n\\nSince 2015, the Beauty Care business unit has been focusing on the \\n\\ncontinuous improvement of Safety, Health and Environment (SHE) \\n\\nissues at our main subcontractors and logistics service providers in \\n\\nChina. Since then, specific SHE training courses have been held each \\n\\nyear on topics such as plant risk assessment, storage safety and occu\\xad\\n\\npational hygiene. We regularly include external SHE experts in our \\n\\ntraining courses, including those conducted in 2017 for working in \\n\\nconfined spaces and disposing of hazardous waste. The training \\n\\ncourses took place on site at certain subcontractors and were also \\n\\nattended by employees of other suppliers.

During the production of an adhesive, an aqueous solvent was \\nunintentionally added, triggering the curing process of the adhesive. The resulting \\nadhesive foam activated the pressure relief system, overflowed out of the containment \\nchamber and spilled onto a street within the site. The hardened foam was mechani-\\ncally removed from the street surface. The incident did not cause any significant \\ninterruption to operations and there were no personal injuries or damage to the \\nenvironment.\\n\\nMeasures initiated: The design of the pressure relief system was examined and the \\nalarm function was tested. A measuring device was installed that continuously moni-\\ntors the solvent to make sure it is free of water. \\nIn December 2016, a fire in a production facility at our adhesives plant in Taizhou, \\nChina, resulted in property damage. The local fire service was quickly able to bring \\nthe fire under control. There was no damage to persons or the environment. The fire \\ncaused a temporary interruption to operations.\\n\\nMeasures initiated: The inspections on the extent of the damage to the plant \\nshowed that the structures would have to be completely rebuilt in order to properly \\nresume operations. As a result, the plant was closed on December 3, 2017. The \\naffected employees were informed of this on November 3, 2017. All measures were \\nconducted in accordance with the legal provisions in effect in China.\\nThere were no operational incidents in 2015.\\nThere were no operational incidents in 2014.\\nThere were no operational incidents in 2013.\\n\\nEnvironmental violations\\nThere were no environmental violations in 2017.\\n\\nThere were no environmental violations in 2016.\\n\\nThere were no environmental violations in 2015.\\nThere were no environmental violations in 2014.\\nThere were no environmental violations in 2013.\\n\\nHenkel Sustainability Report 2017  Foreword Henkel overview Our strategy Management  Purchasing and  supplier management Production Logistics and transport Sustainability stewardship Adhesive Technologies Beauty Care Laundry & Home Care People Social engagement Stakeholder dialog External assessments Indicators Scope and reference frameworkImprintAnnex\\x0c152\\n\\nScope and reference framework\\n\\nGlobal Reporting Index (GRI)\\n\\nUnited Nations Sustainable Development Goals\\n\\nHenkel’s Sustainability Report is orientated towards the principles \\n\\nThe United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) create \\n\\nand standard disclosures of the G4 Sustainability Reporting Guide\\xad\\n\\na\\xa0common understanding of how governments, civil society and \\n\\nlines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the Corporate Account\\xad\\n\\nbusinesses of all sizes and from all industries can join forces to \\n\\ning and Reporting Standard (Scope 1 and 2) and the Corporate Value \\n\\ndrive progress toward ending poverty, ensuring prosperity, and \\n\\nChain (Scope 3) Standard of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol initiative by \\n\\nprotecting the planet.

The main objective is to promote education and equal opportunities in cooperation with the “Fritz Henkel Stiftung” foundation.“Habitat for Humanity”Together with Habitat for Humanity, teams of Henkel employees have been building houses for families in need since 2014. During a week-long  “building trip” in April 2017, Henkel employees helped build a new house for families in need near the Romanian port of Constanta. As part of the “Welcome Home” program, a team of Henkel employees from the Adhesives for Consumers, Craftsmen and Building business area volunteered to spend one week helping to construct multi-family houses for people in need in Macedonia during September. Henkel also supports these activities with dona-tions in kind, for example with building materials.Integration through internshipsIn 2017, we once again focused on the integration of refugees. Together with other companies, as well as the German Federal Employment Agency, Henkel is assisting less-qualified refugees in Germany in taking their first steps into the world of work. In the “Praktikum PLUS Direkt einstieg” pilot project, participants learn practical skills and gain knowledge to prepare them for a future job. They also attend language classes and integration courses.In 2016, Henkel launched a comprehensive program for integrating refugees at its vocational training center in Düsseldorf. In coopera-tion with external partners, as well as authorities, the company pro-vides refugees with career orientation and job shadowing opportuni-ties, internships, coaching, and access to language programs that run for several months. The objective is to support the integration of peo-ple who have high prospects of remaining, at all levels.Get out of the daily office routine and work together to support those in need: With this in mind, around 20 motivated Henkel employees flew to Romania for a “building trip”. For one week they helped build new homes for families.Ahmad Shah Rahmani (right) is a participant in the “Praktikum PLUS Direkteinstieg” integration pro-gram.

When the merchant Fritz Henkel founded his laundry detergent company in 1876, he had the vision of  making people’s lives easier, better and more beautiful. From the beginning, the company assumed responsibility for its employees, the communities it operates in, and society. Today, Henkel has set up management systems for responsible business practice world-wide, and has firmly anchored the mindset of sustainability in its corporate  values.

We want to create more value – for our customers and consumers, our employees, our shareholders, for the communities we operate in, and for our company – while reducing our environ\\xadmental footprint at the same time. We aim to pioneer new solutions for sustainable development while continuing to shape our business responsibly and increasing our economic success. Our sustainability strategy provides a clear framework for this aim and reflects the high expectations of our stakeholders.We are facing immense challenges. Humankind already has a global environmental footprint that is greater than the planet’s resources can sustain. By the year 2050, the world’s population is expected to\\xa0grow to nine billion. The accompanying acceleration in global  economic activity will lead to rising consumption and resource depletion. As a result, competition for resources will intensify in the coming decades. For this reason, we need innovations, products and technologies that enhance quality of life while consuming less input materials. We aim to use our decades of experience in sustainability to develop and implement solutions that are fit for the future together with our partners. Our long\\xadterm goal is to triple the value we create through our business operations in relation to the environmental footprint of our products and services by 2030. We refer to this goal as “Factor 3.”“In the past year, we have  continued to strengthen our leadership in sustainability. Thanks to our clear priorities, the great commitment of our employees and, most of all,  the strong cooperation with  our partners along the value chain, we were able to make significant progress in many areas.”Hans Van BylenChairman of the Management BoardHenkel Sustainability Report 2017 ForewordHenkel overviewOur strategy ManagementPurchasing and  supplier managementProductionLogistics and transportSustainability stewardshipAdhesive TechnologiesBeauty CareLaundry & Home Care PeopleSocial engagementStakeholder dialogExternal assessmentsIndicatorsScope and reference frameworkImprintAnnex \\x0c13Deliver more valueglobal and national priorities to ensure we are working on the issues that are relevant to our business and to sustainable development.Social ProgressPerformanceSafety andHealthF A C T O REnergy and ClimateMaterials and WasteWater and Wastewaterat a reduced footprintOur 20-year goal for 2030 is to triple the value we create for the footprint made by our operations, products and services. We refer to this goal as “Factor 3.”Henkel actively supports the implementation of the 17 Sustainable Develop-ment Goals (SDGs) that were adopted by the 193 United Nations Member States in September 2015. We are convinced that the goals provide a shared focus that can empower collaborative action and will drive much stronger progress toward sustainability. We continuously review our targets and  initiatives to ensure they reflect the priorities set out by the SDGs. Due to our long history of working intensively on all dimensions of sustainability,  as well as our broad product portfolio and presence in diverse markets, Henkel’s activities support almost all of the goals. You can find an overview of our contribution to the SDGs on our   website.Increasing relevance Three key drivers for the coming yearsSustainability continues to gather increasing importance for our We are convinced that our focus on sustainability is more important stakeholders.

Based on this, we set five-year interim targets for our focal areas.Due to the acquisitions made in 2017, and the challenging market conditions facing our consumer business, our growth in net sales per ton of product was below expectations in 2017. The acquisitions led to a change in our portfolio mix, which had an impact on our overall results. Our results regarding occupational safety and environmental footprint were also affected by our acquisitions.

An exposure analysis is carried out in a second step to clarify the extent to which people or the environment could be exposed to this substance. This analysis is important as, in most cases, a harmful effect will only occur when the quantity and con\\xadcentration of the questionable substance reach a certain level.

Less packaging and wasteReducing packaging material or avoiding it completely is the best way to minimize waste and thus negative environmental effects. This is why we aim to do away with all packaging that is not absolutely essential. We continually strive to reduce the quantity of packaging material in the entire product life cycle without impacting the quality, performance, or safety of our products. Packaging is designed in such\\xa0a way that it delivers the performance expected by the consumer while using the least possible amount of materials. To achieve this goal, our packaging engineers work closely with partners along the entire value chain, so they can make use of leading design techniques, modern production technologies and advanced materials in the development process. For example, we cooperate with external research institutions on an ongoing basis to develop packaging  formats that offer the consumer the same quality with less material.2. Better packagingThe most widely used packaging materials made from renewable raw materials are paper and cardboard. We want to continually increase our use of these materials. We also test and assess new packaging materials, such as bioplastics. The polymers of these materials are based on raw materials obtained from plant sources, such as cane sugar or maize. Provided they can deliver the same technical per\\xadformance as conventional polymers, they can offer a good alternative and provide long\\xadterm economic benefits.

In order to meet needs that differ greatly around the world, we pursue different strategies depending on the market situation:•  Globally standardized products: If the needs and expectations of our customers and consumers are standardized, we offer globally standardized products. Examples of this are the internationally standardized requirements for instant adhesives or our industrial adhesives. Foreword Henkel overview Our strategy Management Purchasing and   supplier management Production Logistics and transport Sustainability stewardship Adhesive Technologies Beauty Care Laundry & Home Care People Social engagement Stakeholder dialog External assessments Indicators Scope and reference frameworkHenkel Sustainability Report 2017 ImprintAnnex\\x0c80•  Locally adapted product offerings: If consumer needs, income lev\\xadels or infrastructure differ in our markets, we adapt packaging or distribution channels to local conditions in order to make our products accessible to the broadest possible group of people. Con\\xadsumers of the lowest income level, for example, buy small units as soon as they have enough money available to do so. We take this into account when planning pack sizes. In Latin America, for exam\\xadple, we put our Pril dishwashing liquid on the market in a pack size of 30 milliliters, which is available in retail at a price equivalent to 10 cents. The same applies to our Mas laundry detergent in Mexico. In the South American market, we offer deodorant creams and shampoos in small retail units of between 10 and 20 milliliters.•  Locally adapted products: Different regional conditions may also require the adaptation of our product formulations. In North Africa and Latin America, for example, water is a scarce and valuable resource. So Henkel has brought a fabric softener for washing clothes by hand onto the market in Egypt, Tunisia and Mexico, whose special formulation rinses the suds away more quickly.

This made Henkel one of the first manufacturers of branded con\\xadsumer goods to comply with an amendment to the EU Detergents Regulation, nine months before its entry into force, which requires that detergents for household dishwashers be virtually free of phos\\xadphorus compounds starting in  January 2017.Prof. Dr. Thomas Müller-Kirschbaum (left), Global Research and Develop-ment Manager at the Laundry & Home Care business unit, and Dr. Michael Dreja (right), Global Research Manager at the Laundry & Home Care busi-ness unit, presented the 2017 Laundry & Home Care Research Award to Dr. Peter Hausoul.Henkel Sustainability Report 2017  Foreword Henkel overview Our strategy Management  Purchasing and  supplier management Production Logistics and transport Sustainability stewardship Adhesive Technologies Beauty Care Laundry & Home Care People Social engagement Stakeholder dialog External assessments Indicators Scope and reference frameworkImprintAnnex\\x0c99Detergent innovation: Persil Sauber & GlattLaundry & Home Care launched Persil Sauber & Glatt (Clean & Smooth) in April 2017.

The semi-retirement model enables our employees involved in shift work and in the fire service at all German sites to move gradually away from shift work, which increasingly takes its toll over the years. At the same time, we encourage the targeted training of qualified young people by having their experienced colleagues coach them in direct preparation for a specific role. This ensures that we keep many years of knowledge within Henkel and improves the company‘s future viability.•  Life stages: Our employees are defined by their education, career paths, and social relationships in different life stages. The resulting activities and obligations pose the challenge of combining  personal and working life in a reasonable way. We support our employees by offering them   flexible working models. We also actively help families in achieving a work\\xadlife balance, for example, through the provision of childcare and our   social services. •  Gender: Our goal is to continually increase the share of female  representation at all levels of the organization. To do so, we use  targeted measures in employee acquisition and development. We support the career development of women at all management levels worldwide. In 2017, the proportion of women in management positions was around 34.5 percent. •  Cultures: An international workforce composed of people with  different cultural backgrounds is important in a global company like Henkel, as it enables us to develop an understanding of our markets. In order to meet the challenges of mixed teams, we provide intercultural training courses and workshops. These aim to increase awareness of different value systems and their influence on our daily behavior. Henkel also encourages international transfers within employees’ career paths. The experiences thus gathered open up new ways of thinking.

In 2017, we introduced a new interactive format to communicate and deepen the understanding of our key initiatives and corporate values. The Henkel 2020+ talks are a series of events that deal with strong ideas on a wide range of topics relat\\xading to our strategic priorities, projects, and values. Using concrete examples and personal anecdotes, selected management personnel provide in\\xaddepth insights into the most important topics for Henkel. In the talks, the speakers get to the heart of the issues and then engage in an open and interactive dialog with the employees – either in person or via Skype. After successful kick\\xadoff events in  Düsseldorf with international participation, the talks were held in  Stamford Survey on Henkel 2020+About six months after the introduction of Henkel 2020+, we invited our managers to participate in a survey. The objective was to measure their understanding of our strategic priorities and ambitions and then to further improve our communication and engagement activities based on this feed-back. The response rate was 45 percent, with very positive results over-all. Understanding of and commitment to all the elements of our strategy was well above 90 percent and outperformed external benchmarks. The fact that 80 percent of all managers who responded described their perso-nal contribution in detail is also evidence of this clear understanding. A key finding was the effectiveness of personal communication: Most of the  participating managers learned about Henkel 2020+ at the town hall  meetings of the Management Board or at management conferences. This underscores the unchanged importance of personal communication in  parallel with the trend toward digitalization and new media formats.and Rocky Hill, Connecticut, USA , and broadcast around the world.Employee representationOur various employee representative bodies play a key role. An in\\xaddepth exchange of views and consultations with the management take place both at the operational level, for example, with the local works councils, and across companies with the trade union. We inform our employee representatives regularly and on a timely basis and give them as much detail as possible, for example, regarding the corporate strategy or planned acquisitions. In countries where no employee representation is planned or established, the social dialog with the respective management serves as a voluntary and informal instrument for close exchange. This enables us to improve communi\\xadcation with our employees, include their perspectives early on, and jointly shape future\\xadoriented issues. That helps Henkel avoid conflicts of interest and strengthens employee identification with the company. With the Henkel 2020+ talks, we inspired more than 5,000 employees to implement Henkel’s strategic priorities, projects, and values in their daily professional lives.Henkel Sustainability Report 2017 Foreword Henkel overview Our strategy Management Purchasing and   supplier management Production Logistics and transport Sustainability stewardship Adhesive Technologies Beauty Care Laundry & Home Care People Social engagement Stakeholder dialog External assessments Indicators Scope and reference frameworkImprintAnnex\\x0c116Employee representation plays a particularly important role in Europe.

In July 1940, the company’s Corporate Health Services officially started with a staff of three company doctors.Relaxation as an antidoteIn today’s fast-moving world, conscious relaxation can make a significant contribution to health. Henkel addressed this topic as part of the Life health campaign. Employees at the company’s headquarters in Düssel-dorf, Germany, were able to test different exercise and relaxation methods and find out which one is most effective for them. These included yoga, which simultaneously improves both fitness and mobility, progressive muscle relaxation to relieve tensions, meditation with targeted mindfulness, and concentration exercises to achieve stillness and contentment.

Since 2013, at our corporate headquarters in Düssel-dorf, we have been implementing a demography program after a success-ful pilot phase. This holistic concept includes a combination of preventive occupational healthcare with a general medical check-up, workability index, and employee interviews. From this we can derive profiles of indivi-dual employees’ strengths and weaknesses as well as those of the relevant organizational unit. Employees can be informed of the individual actions they need to take to improve and maintain their health and performance. Plant managers can see the need to take operational measures with regard to workplace design, continuing education, and optimizing the organiza-tion of work and the working atmosphere. This supports them in develop-ing their teams. Since 2016, the businesses have been repeating the pro-gram, as a result of which they can evaluate the development and success of the measures. There were distinctly positive effects in maintaining work-ing capacity and developing a healthier lifestyle. Key issues identified, such as lack of exercise and prevention activities, were addressed with Active Life and the new   preventive healthcare services available all across Germany.In the spring of 2017, Henkel Ukraine employees took the opportunity to explore the Mezhyhirya National Park on bicycles and do something for their health while enjoying themselves.portal.

Focus on safety trainingGlobal safety campaignIn an effort to counteract the often underestimated risk of slipping, stum-bling or falling, Henkel launched a global safety campaign on this subject for the first time. The goal was to raise employee awareness of these risks. At the same time, the campaign was intended to illustrate which behaviors can lead to accidents and what each individual can do to prevent them. As part of this, an interactive eLearning module has been developed that can be accessed worldwide by all employees with computer access. More than 1,000 employees took advantage of this opportunity in 2017. In addition, managers have personally communicated the importance of this topic to their teams in safety-related discussions.Our hands, in particular, are exposed to increased risk in an industrial working environment on a daily basis.

During the production of an adhesive, an aqueous solvent was unintentionally added, triggering the curing process of the adhesive. The resulting adhesive foam activated the pressure relief system, overflowed out of the containment chamber and spilled onto a street within the site. The hardened foam was mechani-cally removed from the street surface. The incident did not cause any significant interruption to operations and there were no personal injuries or damage to the environment.Measures initiated: The design of the pressure relief system was examined and the alarm function was tested. A measuring device was installed that continuously moni-tors the solvent to make sure it is free of water. In December 2016, a fire in a production facility at our adhesives plant in Taizhou, China, resulted in property damage. The local fire service was quickly able to bring the fire under control. There was no damage to persons or the environment. The fire caused a temporary interruption to operations.Measures initiated: The inspections on the extent of the damage to the plant showed that the structures would have to be completely rebuilt in order to properly resume operations. As a result, the plant was closed on December 3, 2017. The affected employees were informed of this on November 3, 2017. All measures were conducted in accordance with the legal provisions in effect in China.There were no operational incidents in 2015.There were no operational incidents in 2014.There were no operational incidents in 2013.Environmental violationsThere were no environmental violations in 2017.There were no environmental violations in 2016.There were no environmental violations in 2015.There were no environmental violations in 2014.There were no environmental violations in 2013.Henkel Sustainability Report 2017  Foreword Henkel overview Our strategy Management  Purchasing and  supplier management Production Logistics and transport Sustainability stewardship Adhesive Technologies Beauty Care Laundry & Home Care People Social engagement Stakeholder dialog External assessments Indicators Scope and reference frameworkImprintAnnex\\x0c152Scope and reference frameworkGlobal Reporting Index (GRI)United Nations Sustainable Development GoalsHenkel’s Sustainability Report is orientated towards the principles The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) create and standard disclosures of the G4 Sustainability Reporting Guide\\xada\\xa0common understanding of how governments, civil society and lines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the Corporate Account\\xadbusinesses of all sizes and from all industries can join forces to ing and Reporting Standard (Scope 1 and 2) and the Corporate Value drive progress toward ending poverty, ensuring prosperity, and Chain (Scope 3) Standard of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol initiative by protecting the planet.
